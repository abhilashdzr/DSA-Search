String to Integer (atoi),"String to Integer (atoi) Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function). The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows: Read in and ignore any leading whitespace. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. ""123"" -> 123, ""0032"" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2). If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1. Return the integer as the final result. Note: Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.

Tag Validator,"Tag Validator Given a string representing a code snippet, implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold: The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid. A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid. A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid. A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid. A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested. A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid). The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>. CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.",https://leetcode.com/problems/tag-validator,LC

Remove Comments,"Remove Comments Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\n'. In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments. The string ""//"" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored. The string ""/*"" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of ""*/"" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string ""/*/"" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning. The first effective comment takes precedence over others. For example, if the string ""//"" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string ""/*"" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored. If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty. There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters. For example, source = ""string s = ""/* Not a comment. */"";"" will not be a test case. Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments. It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so ""/*"" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment. Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details. After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.",https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-comments,LC
Split Linked List in Parts,"Split Linked List in Parts Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer k, split the linked list into k consecutive linked list parts.

The parts should be in the order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal to parts occurring later. Return an array of the k parts.",https://leetcode.com/problems/split-linked-list-in-parts,LC
Number of Atoms,"Number of Atoms Given a string formula representing a chemical formula, return the count of each atom. The atomic element always starts with an uppercase character, then zero or more lowercase letters, representing the name. One or more digits representing that element's count may follow if the count is greater than 1. If the count is 1, no digits will follow. For example, ""H2O"" and ""H2O2"" are possible, but ""H1O2"" is impossible. Two formulas are concatenated together to produce another formula. For example, ""H2O2He3Mg4"" is also a formula. A formula placed in parentheses, and a count (optionally added) is also a formula. For example, ""(H2O2)"" and ""(H2O2)3"" are formulas. Return the count of all elements as a string in the following form: the first name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), followed by the second name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), and so on.

Parse Lisp Expression,"Parse Lisp Expression You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of. The syntax for these expressions is given as follows. An expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer. (An integer could be positive or negative.) A let expression takes the form ""(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)"", where let is always the string ""let"", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr. An add expression takes the form ""(add e1 e2)"" where add is always the string ""add"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2. A mult expression takes the form ""(mult e1 e2)"" where mult is always the string ""mult"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2. For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names ""add"", ""let"", and ""mult"" are protected and will never be used as variable names. Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.",https://leetcode.com/problems/parse-lisp-expression,LC

Basic Calculator IV,"Basic Calculator IV Given an expression such as expression = ""e + 8 - a + 5"" and an evaluation map such as {""e"": 1} (given in terms of evalvars = [""e""] and evalints = [1]), return a list of tokens representing the simplified expression, such as [""-1*a"",""14""] An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol. A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer. A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like ""2x"" or ""-x"". Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction. For example, expression = ""1 + 2 * 3"" has an answer of [""7""]. The format of the output is as follows: For each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically. For example, we would never write a term like ""b*a*c"", only ""a*b*c"". Terms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term. For example, ""a*a*b*c"" has degree 4. The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.) A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed. An example of a well-formatted answer is [""-2*a*a*a"", ""3*a*a*b"", ""3*b*b"", ""4*a"", ""5*c"", ""-6""]. Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.

Find And Replace in String,"Find And Replace in String You are given a 0-indexed string s that you must perform k replacement operations on. The replacement operations are given as three 0-indexed parallel arrays, indices, sources, and targets, all of length k. To complete the ith replacement operation: Check if the substring sources[i] occurs at index indices[i] in the original string s. If it does not occur, do nothing. Otherwise if it does occur, replace that substring with targets[i]. For example, if s = ""abcd"", indices[i] = 0, sources[i] = ""ab"", and targets[i] = ""eee"", then the result of this replacement will be ""eeecd"". All replacement operations must occur simultaneously, meaning the replacement operations should not affect the indexing of each other. The testcases will be generated such that the replacements will not overlap.

These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule.

In other words: If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it must wait for two hydrogen threads. If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it must wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread. We do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with.

You are also given an array sums containing the values of all 2n subset sums of the unknown array (in no particular order). Return the array ans of length n representing the unknown array. If multiple answers exist, return any of them. An array sub is a subset of an array arr if sub can be obtained from arr by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements of arr. The sum of the elements in sub is one possible subset sum of arr. The sum of an empty array is considered to be 0. Note: Test cases are generated such that there will always be at least one correct answer.",https://leetcode.com/problems/find-array-given-subset-sums,LC
Find the Kth Largest Integer in the Array,"Find the Kth Largest Integer in the Array You are given an array of strings nums and an integer k. Each string in nums represents an integer without leading zeros. Return the string that represents the kth largest integer in nums. Note: Duplicate numbers should be counted distinctly. For example, if nums is [""1"",""2"",""2""], ""2"" is the first largest integer, ""2"" is the second-largest integer, and ""1"" is the third-largest integer.",https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-kth-largest-integer-in-the-array,LC
Minimum Number of Work Sessions to Finish the Tasks,"Minimum Number of Work Sessions to Finish the Tasks There are n tasks assigned to you. The task times are represented as an integer array tasks of length n, where the ith task takes tasks[i] hours to finish. A work session is when you work for at most sessionTime consecutive hours and then take a break. You should finish the given tasks in a way that satisfies the following conditions: If you start a task in a work session, you must complete it in the same work session. You can start a new task immediately after finishing the previous one. You may complete the tasks in any order. Given tasks and sessionTime, return the minimum number of work sessions needed to finish all the tasks following the conditions above. The tests are generated such that sessionTime is greater than or equal to the maximum element in tasks[i].",https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-work-sessions-to-finish-the-tasks,LC
Number of Unique Good Subsequences,"Number of Unique Good Subsequences You are given a binary string binary. A subsequence of binary is considered good if it is not empty and has no leading zeros (with the exception of ""0""). Find the number of unique good subsequences of binary. For example, if binary = ""001"", then all the good subsequences are [""0"", ""0"", ""1""], so the unique good subsequences are ""0"" and ""1"". Note that subsequences ""00"", ""01"", and ""001"" are not good because they have leading zeros. Return the number of unique good subsequences of binary. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.",https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-unique-good-subsequences,LC
Find All Groups of Farmland,"Find All Groups of Farmland You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix land where a 0 represents a hectare of forested land and a 1 represents a hectare of farmland. To keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares that consist entirely of farmland. These rectangular areas are called groups. No two groups are adjacent, meaning farmland in one group is not four-directionally adjacent to another farmland in a different group. land can be represented by a coordinate system where the top left corner of land is (0, 0) and the bottom right corner of land is (m-1, n-1). Find the coordinates of the top left and bottom right corner of each group of farmland. A group of farmland with a top left corner at (r1, c1) and a bottom right corner at (r2, c2) is represented by the 4-length array [r1, c1, r2, c2]. Return a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays described above for each group of farmland in land. If there are no groups of farmland, return an empty array. You may return the answer in any order.",https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-groups-of-farmland,LC
Operations on Tree,"Operations on Tree You are given a tree with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 in the form of a parent array parent where parent[i] is the parent of the ith node. The root of the tree is node 0, so parent[0] = -1 since it has no parent. You want to design a data structure that allows users to lock, unlock, and upgrade nodes in the tree. The data structure should support the following functions: Lock: Locks the given node for the given user and prevents other users from locking the same node. You may only lock a node using this function if the node is unlocked. Unlock: Unlocks the given node for the given user. You may only unlock a node using this function if it is currently locked by the same user. Upgrade: Locks the given node for the given user and unlocks all of its descendants regardless of who locked it. You may only upgrade a node if all 3 conditions are true: The node is unlocked, It has at least one locked descendant (by any user), and It does not have any locked ancestors. Implement the LockingTree class: LockingTree(int[] parent) initializes the data structure with the parent array. lock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to lock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become locked by the user with id user. unlock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to unlock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become unlocked. upgrade(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to upgrade the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will be upgraded.",https://leetcode.com/problems/operations-on-tree,LC
The Number of Good Subsets,"The Number of Good Subsets You are given an integer array nums. We call a subset of nums good if its product can be represented as a product of one or more distinct prime numbers. For example, if nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]: [2, 3], [1, 2, 3], and [1, 3] are good subsets with products 6 = 2*3, 6 = 2*3, and 3 = 3 respectively. [1, 4] and [4] are not good subsets with products 4 = 2*2 and 4 = 2*2 respectively. Return the number of different good subsets in nums modulo 109 + 7. A subset of nums is any array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) elements from nums. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.",https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-good-subsets,LC
Count Special Quadruplets,"Count Special Quadruplets Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, return the number of distinct quadruplets (a, b, c, d) such that: nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] == nums[d], and a < b < c < d",https://leetcode.com/problems/count-special-quadruplets,LC

First Day Where You Have Been in All the Rooms,"First Day Where You Have Been in All the Rooms There are n rooms you need to visit, labeled from 0 to n - 1. Each day is labeled, starting from 0. You will go in and visit one room a day. Initially on day 0, you visit room 0. The order you visit the rooms for the coming days is determined by the following rules and a given 0-indexed array nextVisit of length n: Assuming that on a day, you visit room i, if you have been in room i an odd number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit a room with a lower or equal room number specified by nextVisit[i] where 0 <= nextVisit[i] <= i; if you have been in room i an even number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit room (i + 1) mod n. Return the label of the first day where you have been in all the rooms. It can be shown that such a day exists.
