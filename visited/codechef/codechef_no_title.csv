Chef and String ,"There are N students standing in a row and numbered 1 through N from left to right. You are given a string S with length N, where for each valid i, the i-th character of S is 'x' if the i-th student is a girl or 'y' if this student is a boy. Students standing next to each other in the row are friends. The students are asked to form pairs for a dance competition. Each pair must consist of a boy and a girl. Two students can only form a pair if they are friends. Each student can only be part of at most one pair. What is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed?

Alternating subarray prefix ,"There's an array A consisting of N non-zero integers A1..N. A subarray of A is called alternating if any two adjacent elements in it have different signs (i.e. one of them should be negative and the other should be positive). For each x from 1 to N, compute the length of the longest alternating subarray that starts at x - that is, a subarray Ax..y for the maximum possible y ≥ x. The length of such a subarray is y-x+1.

Chef and Wedding Arrangements ,"There are N guests (numbered 1 through N) coming to Chef's wedding. Each guest is part of a family; for each valid i, the i-th guest is part of family FiFiF_i. You need to help Chef find an optimal seating arrangement. Chef may buy a number of tables, which are large enough for any number of guests, but the people sitting at each table must have consecutive numbers ― for any two guests i and j (i<ji<ji lt j) sitting at the same table, guests i+1,i+2,…,j−1i+1,i+2,…,j−1i+1, i+2, ldots, j-1 must also sit at that table. Chef would have liked to seat all guests at a single table; however, he noticed that two guests i and j are likely to get into an argument if Fi=FjFi=FjF_i = F_j and they are sitting at the same table. Each table costs K rupees. Chef defines the inefficiency of a seating arrangement as the total cost of tables plus the number of guests who are likely to get into an argument with another guest. Tell Chef the minimum possible inefficiency which he can achieve.

Watching CPL ,"Get excited, folks, because it is time for the final match of Codechef Premier League (CPL)! Mike and Tracy also want to watch the grand finale, but unfortunately, they could not get tickets to the match. However, Mike is not someone who gives up so easily — he has a plan to watch the match. The field where the match is played is surrounded by a wall with height K. Outside, there are N boxes (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the i-th box has a height HiHiH_i. Mike wants to take some boxes and stack them on top of each other to build two towers. The height of each tower is the sum of heights of all the boxes that form it. Of course, no box may be in both towers. The height of each tower should be at least K. Then Mike can climb on top of one tower and Tracy on top of the other, and they can watch the match uninterrupted! While Mike is busy stacking the boxes, Tracy would like to know the smallest number of boxes required to build two towers such that each of them has height at least K, or at least that it is impossible to build such towers.

N different palindromes ,"A palindrome is a string that reads same in both directions: forwards and backwards. For example, the strings radar and noon are palindromes, whereas the string chef is not a palindrome as being read backwards is becomes equal to fehc, which is not equal to chef. Let's say that the pair of indices (i, j) denotes a palindrome in some string S iff i ≤ j and the substring starting at the i-th character and ending at the j-th character of S is a palindrome. Given an integer N. Your task is to construct a string S such that there are exactly N different pairs (i, j) that denotes a palindrome.

(CH) Bear and Sorted Rows ,"Limak has a grid that consists of N rows and N columns. He randomly wrote all numbers 1 through N2 in the cells of the grid, one number in each cell. You can assume that each of (N2)! ways was equally likely. Limak asks you to rearrange the numbers in the grid, so that each row will be sorted either increasingly or decreasingly. Scoring Let (r, c) denote the cell at the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column. If a number x was in (r1, c1) in the initial grid and it is in (r2, c2) in the new grid, the cost of moving x is (r1 - r2)2 + (c1 - c2)2. Your score for one test is the sum of costs of moving all numbers, divided by N3 for clarity. The final score is the sum of scores in all tests. The goal is to minimize that score. There are 20 tests. If your program works incorrectly (e.g. it exceeds the time limit or rows aren't sorted) on any of 20 tests, you will get a suitable verdict (e.g. TLE or WA). Otherwise, you will get AC and your score will be decided by only 20% of tests (first 4 tests). The final score will be revealed after the contest.

Gravity Guy ,"Chef likes to play games a lot. is one such interesting game. ""is an arcade side-scrolling game in which the player controls by tapping the screen to switch gravity. The objective in this game is to run as far as possible while avoiding being trapped by obstacles, falling, or flying off the screen. If hit by obstacles, the game is over."" Chef is so addicted to this game that each night he dreams of himself being in the game as Gravity Guy. He has two lanes in front of him represented by two strings of equal length named as L1 and L2. Each of the two lanes consists of some clean blocks represented by '.' and some dirty blocks represented by '#'. Chef can start running from the beginning of any of the two lanes and cannot step over any dirty block ( '#' ) encountered during his journey. He has to complete his journey by reaching the end block of any of the two lanes. Chef can use the following jumps to reach his destination. Considering chef is at xth block of some lane. He can jump to x+1th block of the same lane. He can switch gravity quickly and jump to xth block of the other lane. He can switch gravity and jump to x+1th block of the other lane. You have to tell him whether he can reach his destination or not. If it is possible for him to reach his destination, then Chef is interested in knowing the minimum number of gravity switches required to reach the destination.

Decomposition Reaction ,"A thermal decomposition reaction is breakdown of a compound into one or more compounds when heated. For example, P→a⋅Q+b⋅RP→a⋅Q+b⋅RP rightarrow acdot Q + bcdot R is a decomposition reaction. Here, 1 unit of P is converted into a unit of Q and b unit of R after completion of the reaction. You are given N compounds numbered from 1 to N. The initial amount of the ithithi^{th} compound is QiQiQ_i. You are also given M equations. Every equation is of the form: C0→W1⋅C1+W2⋅C2+…+WX⋅CXC0→W1⋅C1+W2⋅C2+…+WX⋅CXC_0 rightarrow W_1cdot C_1 + W_2cdot C_2 + ldots + W_Xcdot C_X. Here: C0C0C_0 represents the compound which will decompose into X compounds on heating. CiCiC_i (1≤i≤X)(1≤i≤X)(1 leq i leq X ) represents the compounds into which C0C0C_0 is decomposed. WiWiW_i (1≤i≤X)(1≤i≤X)(1 leq i leq X ) represents the number of units of CiCiC_i produced due to the decomposition of C0C0C_0. Ci>Ci−1Ci>Ci−1C_i > C_{i-1} for all (1≤i≤X)(1≤i≤X)(1 leq i leq X).

Pizza Delivery ,"Chef Po had recently started home delivery service for pizzas. Po has only a single delivery boy that delivers the orders by riding his motorcycle. The motorcycle has an unlimited capacity of fuel tank. However, it is too old and can only ride 1 km for each 1 liter of fuel. There are N fuel stations near the restaurant. The ithithi^{th} fuel station can fill a fuel tank exactly KiKiK_{i} litres; not more and not less. Filling a fuel tank with any amount of fuel in those stations tends to take a long time. Since the fuel stations are placed near the restaurant, no fuel is needed to go to a fuel station. Today Chef Po received N pizza orders, which is the same number of fuel stations fortuitously. The house of the person that ordered the ithithi^{th} order is HiHiH_{i} km away from the restaurant. The delivery boy cannot deliver more than one order at a time. Therefore, after delivering an order, he must return back to the restaurant to take the next order. The delivery boy is an efficient person and thus he wants to fill the fuel tank with the exact amount of fuel required to deliver an order and return back. He also does not want to spends much time filling the tank, so he wants to minimize the number of times he fills the tank. Help him determine the minimum number of times he must fill the tank to deliver all orders. Tags: Dynamic Programming Algorithms ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/DBOY,CC

Car-pal Tunnel ,"There is a straight road that passes through N short tunnels. At the entrance to the first tunnel, there are C cars lined up in a row waiting to enter the series of tunnels. The distance between each pair of consecutive tunnels is D metres (the lengths of each tunnel and each car are negligible) and the velocity of each car is S metres per second. Each tunnel contains a toll booth. In the i-th tunnel (1 ≤ i ≤ N), processing a car at the toll booth takes Ai seconds. Only one car can be processed at the same time. If there are multiple cars in the tunnel, they all have to wait for the first car to be processed; afterwards, the first car exits the tunnel, the second car starts being processed and all remaining cars have to wait again, etc. Whenever a car arrives in a tunnel, it has to wait at that tunnel's toll booth until all previous cars have been processed and then get processed itself. The road and the tunnels are too narrow, so cars can't overtake each other at any time during the journey. Chef is after Reziba once again. Reziba's car is the first car to enter the tunnels, while Chef's car is the last car to enter the tunnels. Compute the final delay (in seconds) between the first (Reziba's) car and the last (Chef's) car immediately after Chef's car exits the last tunnel, i.e. after all the cars have passed through the tunnels. This delay is equal to the distance between the first and the last car divided by the cars' velocity, or equivalently to the difference between the times when the last car and the first car exit the last tunnel.

He summons the Wizard of Dessert to help him with one such dish. The wizard provides the chef with a sequence of N ingredients where the ith ingredient has a delish value of D[i]. The preparation of the dish takes place in two phases. Phase 1 : The chef chooses two indices i and j and adds the ingredients i, i+1, ., j to his dish. He also finds the sum of the delish value in this range i.e D[i] + D[i+1] + . + D[j]. Phase 2 : The chef chooses two more indices k and l and adds the ingredients k, k+1, ., l to his dish. He also finds the sum of the delish value in this range i.e D[k] + D[k+1] + . + D[l]. Note that 1 ≤ i ≤ j < k ≤ l ≤ N.

Leonard is baffled when he is asked this question. Your task is to help Leonard in writing a program to compute the total number of ways one can score a total of X points by hitting any combination of Cannon and In-Off shots. The order in which the shots are hit have importance. For example, 5 can be scored in two ways, by hitting an In-Off Shot followed by a Cannon shot or a Cannon Shot followed by an In-Off shot.

Way Out ,"Oh, no! Chef’s in trouble. He’s got himself stuck in a cave (we don’t know how) and is looking for a way out. The bigger problem is that he needs to get his tractor out of the cave (don't ask why Chef owns a tractor!). He currently faces a large block of height N cells and length N cells, and needs to get his tractor across this block. The block is made up of vertical columns of soil, each of which is one cell long. Each column has a continuous vertical gap, with the ith column having its gap from the lith cell to the hith cell (starting from the bottom, 0-indexing). That is, in the ith column, there is no soil from the lith cell to the hith cell (both inclusive). Chef can build additional gaps by clearing some cells of soil. His tractor has height H, and therefore, he needs to build a horizontal corridor of height H passing through all the columns. That is, some consecutive H rows must have no soil. Please see the figures in the example and explanation sections for more details. Chef is able to clear one cell of soil by spending one unit of energy.

The problem is Ron really love coding and he doesn't care about other stuff. This course even gives him more stress. However, like it or not Ron still need to try his best not to let this course ruins his great GPA. Can you help him with his first assignment which is described below. In this assignment, Ron is given an N×N pixels image called sample image. Ron is required to create a copy of the sample image using an simple graphic painting program called SMPaint. Only two types of operation can be used in SMPaint: Init: Make the new image with the specific size, all the pixels of the new image are white. Paint: User gives 5 integers C, U, D, L, R and SMPaint will change colour to C at all the pixels (x, y) such that (U ≤ x ≤ D and L ≤ y ≤ R). The pixel (x, y) is the pixel at the xth row (from the top, 1-indexed) and the yth column (from the left side, 1-indexed). We can see that the Paint operation actually is painting a specific rectangle in the image by one specific colour. The image in the figure 1 can be drawn using 3 calls of the second function if we paint the red rectangle first and then paint two green rectangles. Notice that if a pixel is changed colour several time, it final colour is corresponding to the last time it is painted. This help us save some calls of the second function. For the image in figure 1 we can paint a large green rectangle first and then paint the red rectangle. Your mission is help Ron finish the assignment with using as least as possible number of calls of the second function.

Byteland Tours ,"As part of a new program to attract tourists to Byteland, Chef has been placed in charge of organizing a series of bus tours around the city. There are N scenic locations (points on the plane) in Byteland (numbered 0 through N-1), and M bidirectional scenic roads, each of which connects two scenic locations via a straight line. Chef wishes to organize the tours according to the following rules: A tour is defined as sequence of locations, where a tour bus begins at the first location, and moves directly from each location to the next location in the sequence until it reaches the last location. There must be a scenic road between consecutive locations. A tour does not have to start and end at the same location, but it is allowed. A tour cannot visit the same location more than once, with the possible exception of the start/end location. A tour cannot cross itself. That is, none of the roads belonging to a tour may intersect. Each road must be visited by exactly one tour. Setting up tours is expensive, so Chef wishes to minimize the total number of tours. Optimal solutions are not required, but solutions that use fewer tours will score more points (see the scoring section below). However, your solution must use at most (N+M)/2 tours or else it will be judged Wrong Answer.

Spheres ,"The first set consists of N upper hemispheres indexed 1 to N and the second has M lower hemispheres indexed 1 to M. The hemispheres in any sequence can have different radii. He is now set out on building spheres using them. To build a sphere of radius R, he must take one upper half of the radius R and one lower half of the radius R. Also, he can put a sphere into a bigger one and create a sequence of nested concentric spheres. But he can't put two or more spheres directly into another one. Examples: If there is a sequence of (D+1) nested spheres, we can call this sequence as a D-sequence. Eugene has to find out how many different X-sequence are possible (1 <= X <= C). An X sequence is different from another if the index of any of the hemisphere used in one X-sequence is different from the other. Eugene doesn't know how to do it, so Chef agreed to help him. Of course, Chef is too busy now and he asks you to help him. Tags: aangairbender, dynamic-programming, easy, oct15 ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/KSPHERES,CC
Barcelona Gameplay Tactics ,"As we all know, F.C. Barcelona is the best soccer team of our era! Their entangling and mesmerizing game style usually translates into very high ball possession, consecutive counter-attack plays and goals. Lots of goals, thanks to the natural talent of their attacker and best player in history, Lionel Andres Messi. However, at the most prestigious tournament of individual teams, the UEFA Champions League, there are no guarantees and believe it or not, Barcelona is in trouble.. They are tied versus Chelsea, which is a very defending team that usually relies on counter-strike to catch opposing teams off guard and we are in the last minute of the match. So Messi decided to settle things down for good and now he is conducting the ball on his teams' midfield and he will start a lethal counter-attack :D After dribbling the 2 strikers from Chelsea, he now finds himself near the center of the field and he won't be able to dribble the entire team on his own, so he will need to pass the ball to one of his teammates, run forward and receive the ball once again to score the final goal. Exactly K players are with him on his counter-attack and the coach, Tito Villanova knows that this counter-attack will end in a goal only if after exactly N passes are performed between the players, Messi ends up with the ball. (Note that the ball only needs to end with Messi after exactly N passes are performed between all the K+1 players, i.e. Messi can receive the ball several times during the N passes. See the 2nd test case explanation for further clarification. ) However, he realized that there are many scenarios possible for this, so he asked you, his assistant coach, to tell him in how many ways can Messi score the important victory goal. So help him!! Tags: Combinatorics, Dynamic Programming Mathematics, Algorithms ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/FCBARCA,CC
Merging Binary Strings ,"You have two binary strings A and B, both of length N. You have to merge both the binary strings to form a new binary string C of length 2⋅N2⋅N2 cdot N. The relative order of characters in the original binary strings A and B should not change in the binary string C. For example, if A=01011A=01011A = {color{blue}01011} and B=10100B=10100B = {color{red}10100}, one possible way to merge them to form C is: C=0101101100C=0101101100C = {color{blue}0}{color{red}1}{color{red}0}{color{blue}1}{color{red}1}{color{blue}0}{color{blue}1}{color{blue}1}{color{red}0}{color{red}0}. Minimize the number of inversions in the merged binary string C. As a reminder, a pair of indices (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) is an inversion for binary string C if and only if 1≤i<j≤|C|1≤i<j≤|C|1 leq i lt j leq |C|, Ci=1Ci=1C_i = 1 and Cj=0Cj=0C_j = 0.

Chef and Big Soccer ,"Chef is a big fan of soccer! He loves soccer so much, that he even invented soccer for his pet dogs! Here are the rules of the game: There are N dogs numerated from 1 to N stay in a line, so dogs i and i + 1 are adjacent. There is a ball which dogs will pass around. Initially, dog s has the ball. A dog with ball can pass it to another dog. If the current pass-strength of dog is x, then it can pass the ball to either dog i - x or dog i + x (provided such dog/s exist). To make it even more exciting, Chef created an array A of M positive integers denoting pass strengths. In i-th pass, current pass-strength of the dog making the pass will be given by Ai. Chef asks dogs to execute these M passes one by one. As stated before, dog s will make the first pass, then some other dog and so on till M passes. Dogs quickly found out that there can be lot of possible sequences of passes which will end up with a dog having the ball. Now each dog asks your help in finding number of different pass sequences which result in this dog ending up ball. Two pass sequences are considered different if after some number of passes they lead the ball to different dogs. As the answer could be quite large, output it modulo 109 + 7 (1007).

Chef is now wondering: in how many ways is it possible to shuffle the bits of A and the bits of B such that their sum after shuffling is equal to C? Let's denote the integers obtained by shuffling the bits of A and B by AsAsA_s and BsBsB_s respectively; two ways (As1,Bs1)(As1,Bs1)(A_{s1}, B_{s1}) and (As2,Bs2)(As2,Bs2)(A_{s2}, B_{s2}) are considered distinct if As1≠As2As1≠As2A_{s1} neq A_{s2} or Bs1≠Bs2Bs1≠Bs2B_{s1} neq B_{s2}.

In other words, sequence s can be obtained from the a by deleting some elements. Sequence s[1], s[2], ., s[k] is called an arithmetic progression, if it can be represented as : s[1] = p, where p — some integer; s[i] = p + (i - 1)·q (i > 1), where q — some integer.

This way, Chef obtains NN pairs (C1,1),(C2,2),…,(CN,N)(C_1,1), (C_2,2), ldots, (C_N,N) and he sorts all these pairs (Ci,i)(C_i, i) in descending order (first by CiC_i and in the case of a tie by ii). For example, consider the tree below: The sorted list of pairs is ((2,2),(1,3),(1,1))((2,2), (1,3), (1,1)). Chef quizzes you on this list ― he wants you to find the KK-th pair in the sorted list. To make that task easier, Chef only asks for K=1K = 1 (the largest pair) or K=2K = 2 (the second largest pair).

W String ,"Kira likes to play with strings very much. Moreover he likes the shape of 'W' very much. He takes a string and try to make a 'W' shape out of it such that each angular point is a '#' character and each sides has same characters. He calls them W strings. For example, the W string can be formed from ""a#bb#cc#dd"" such as: a a d a # d a b c d a b c d # # He also call the strings which can generate a 'W' shape (satisfying the above conditions) W strings. More formally, a string S is a W string if and only if it satisfies the following conditions (some terms and notations are explained in Note, please see it if you cannot understand): The string S contains exactly 3 '#' characters. Let the indexes of all '#' be P1 < P2 < P3 (indexes are 0-origin). Each substring of S[0, P1−1], S[P1+1, P2−1], S[P2+1, P3−1], S[P3+1, |S|−1] contains exactly one kind of characters, where S[a, b] denotes the non-empty substring from a+1th character to b+1th character, and |S| denotes the length of string S (See Note for details). Now, his friend Ryuk gives him a string S and asks him to find the length of the longest W string which is a subsequence of S, with only one condition that there must not be any '#' symbols between the positions of the first and the second '#' symbol he chooses, nor between the second and the third (here the ""positions"" we are looking at are in S), i.e. suppose the index of the '#'s he chooses to make the W string are P1, P2, P3 (in increasing order) in the original string S, then there must be no index i such that S[i] = '#' where P1 < i < P2 or P2 < i < P3. Help Kira and he won't write your name in the Death Note. Note: For a given string S, let S[k] denote the k+1th character of string S, and let the index of the character S[k] be k. Let |S| denote the length of the string S. And a substring of a string S is a string S[a, b] = S[a] S[a+1] . S[b], where 0 ≤ a ≤ b < |S|. And a subsequence of a string S is a string S[i0] S[i1] . S[in−1], where 0 ≤ i0 < i1 < . < in−1 < |S|. For example, let S be the string ""kira"", then S[0] = 'k', S[1] = 'i', S[3] = 'a', and |S| = 4. All of S[0, 2] = ""kir"", S[1, 1] = ""i"", and S[0, 3] = ""kira"" are substrings of S, but ""ik"", ""kr"", and ""arik"" are not. All of ""k"", ""kr"", ""kira"", ""kia"" are subsequences of S, but ""ik"", ""kk"" are not. From the above definition of W string, for example, ""a#b#c#d"", ""a#y#a#yy"", and ""o#oo#o#oo"" are W string, but ""a#b#c#d#e"", ""#a#a#a"", and ""aa##a#a"" are not.

Whenever we clean a window (i,j)(i,j)(i, j), it becomes clean, but the dirty water used for cleaning it flows down to windows (i−1,j−1)(i−1,j−1)(i-1, j-1), (i−1,j)(i−1,j)(i-1, j) and (i−1,j+1)(i−1,j+1)(i-1, j+1) (more precisely, to all of these windows which exist), so these windows become dirty again. Then, the water flows further down, so the same applies for other windows below: whenever a window (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) becomes dirty, windows (i−1,j−1)(i−1,j−1)(i-1, j-1), (i−1,j)(i−1,j)(i-1, j) and (i−1,j+1)(i−1,j+1)(i-1, j+1) become dirty as well. For example, cleaning a window (5,3)(5,3)(5, 3) will make the window (3,2)(3,2)(3, 2) dirty. The next window is cleaned only after water flows down completely. Note that each window is cleaned only once and there may be dirty windows at the end. For each window, determine whether it will be clean after the cleaning process ends.

List Editing ,"At the ACME University, as part of the Graduate course work, each student is required to undergo project work. The authorities always make an effort to find a match among the students’ interests and the interests of the faculty members. First, they take a list of topics from the students' and a list of topics from the faculty. In order to avoid identifying students and faculties, all they preserve is simply, two consolidated lists of topics – one from the students and one from the faculties. No personal identification exists within these lists. The lists are sorted in ascending order of the indices of project topics in the repository. No topic appears twice in the same list. To make the process simple, ACME University maintains a repository of 100 project topics - numbered from 1 to 100, inclusive. The students and faculty members must choose among those topics only. Their lists may have different number of topics; since more than one student (or faculty) may choose to work work on the same topic or some may like to work on multiple topics etc. Once these two lists have been obtained, the university tries to make them identical. The student’s list is modified to match with the faculty’s list. The modification may be via inserting a new topic in the list deleting a topic from the list substituting a topic by another one The university wants to do this with minimal number of modifications to the list as each modification needs one full day to be communicated and accepted by the students.

Tree Permutations ,"You are given a tree with N nodes (numbered 1 through N), rooted at node 1. For each valid i, node i has a value aiaia_i written on it. An undirected simple path between any two nodes u and v is said to be vertical if u=vu=vu=v or u is an ancestor of v or v is an ancestor of u. Let's define a vertical partition of the tree as a set of vertical paths such that each node belongs to exactly one of these paths. You are also given a sequence of N integers b1,b2,…,bNb1,b2,…,bNb_1, b_2, ldots, b_N. A vertical partition is good if, for each of its paths, we can permute the values written on the nodes in this path, and this can be done in such a way that we reach a state where for each valid i, the value written on node i is bibib_i. The difficulty of your task is described by a parameter S. If S=1S=1S=1, your task is only to determine whether at least one good vertical partition exists. If S=2S=2S=2, you are required to find the number of good vertical partitions modulo 1,0,0,0071,0,0,0071,0,0,007 (109+7109+710^9+7).

Beautiful Bricks ,". Chef offers delicious food in his restaurant, but he wants to make it a more attractive place too. The guests in the restaurant usually walk along a path consisting of two adjacent, parallel rows of square bricks leading to the entrance. Each row is N bricks long, all bricks have the same size and there are no holes. Unfortunately, the path looks pretty boring because all bricks have the same color. In order to make it more interesting, Chef wants to replace exactly K bricks by more beautiful ones in such a way that no two replaced bricks share a side. Chef asks you to answer a question that is too complicated for him: in how many ways can Chef select the bricks to replace? Since the answer can be very large, compute it modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7.

Gift and Chef ,"Last week Penguin Charlie had a birthday. Chef presented him a string S. Unfortunately, Charlie doesn't like string S, he likes string F. Charlie wants to create a few strings F from S by cutting. Cutting means getting some substrings from S that are equal to F and delete them from string S. After deleting a substring, the left and right parts of the resulting string remain separated. Note, a substring of a string S is a consecutive sequence of characters in S. In some cases Charlie can still get substrings equal to F from the pieces that remain after cutting the original string. Your task is to calculate the number of ways to cut out at least one occurrence of the substring F in S. As this number may be too large, print it modulo 109 + 7.

Encoding ,"Chef is trying to open the oven in his kitchen to cook some cookies. However, the oven is special ― you need a password to open it. Let's define a function f(x)f(x)f(x) for a positive integer x as follows: Consider the decimal representation of x (without leading zeros). Split it into the minimum number of contiguous subsequences of digits such that in each subsequence, all digits are identical. For each subsequence, look at its position in the original decimal representation of x. Let's say that the most significant digit it contained was the e-th digit, where e=0e=0e=0 corresponds to the least significant digit of x. For example, 388,822,442388,822,442388,822,442 can be split into subsequences ""3"", ""8"", ""22"", ""44"", ""2"", where e=7e=7e=7 for the sequence ""8"" and e=4e=4e=4 for the sequence ""22"". The value of a subsequence which contains a digit d repeated one or more times is d⋅10ed⋅10ed cdot 10^e. f(x)f(x)f(x) is the sum of values of these subsequences. For example, f(388,822,442)=3⋅108+8⋅107+2⋅104+4⋅102+2⋅100f(388,822,442)=3⋅108+8⋅107+2⋅104+4⋅102+2⋅100f(388,822,442) = 3 cdot 10^8 + 8 cdot 10^7 + 2 cdot 10^4 + 4 cdot 10^2 + 2 cdot 10^0. The oven has a screen which displays two long integers L and R (with NLNLN_L and NRNRN_R digits respectively, without leading zeros). The password is the sum of f(x)f(x)f(x) for each x between L and R inclusive. Chef does not have a lot of time, so he asks for your help. Please find the password for the oven so that he can start cooking as fast as possible. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7.

Finding Hardest Sum Value ,"Ramesh, Suresh, Mahesh, and Mukesh are moving to a new city and are looking for apartments to live. Now this city is not like any other city. This city is a matrix of apartments and there are no roads. The only way to commute is to go through apartments. If any of the friends go through an apartment even once, the group will have to pay its full rent. From an apartment, you can go to the apartments to its North, South, East, or West. Since Ramesh, Suresh, Mahesh, and Mukesh are best friends, they want to meet each other at least once a month. Also, all four are highly superstitious, so Ramesh only goes West, Suresh only goes North, Mahesh only goes East, and Mukesh only goes South. Any number of people can live in any of the apartments. Cost of all the apartments in the city is given, some of which may be negative. Negative cost means if any of the friend lives in or goes through this apartment, the group will get paid an amount equal to the negation of the cost. Now the aim of the four friends is to find the minimum cost for which all of them can live in the city and meet each other at least once a month.

Lock-Free Stack ,"Sergey recently studied lock-free data structures. He particularly liked the data structure called Lock-Free Stack. So, lock-free stack is basically an ordinary stack, which can be used by multiple threads of the same program. There are N threads, which do push and pop the numbers to this stack simultaneously. In order to check his knowledge, Sergey implemented this data structure. But he was still unsure, whether his code works correct or not. So he made the test case of the following kind: For every thread (say, the ith), there is a list of Ai numbers, which will be pushed to the stack by this thread in this order (so, first, the first number from this list will be added, then the second one, and so on). So Sergey runs the program, the numbers get pushed to the stack from all the threads simultaneously. When all the threads are done with it, he wanted to pop all the numbers from the stack and to check the correctness of the output. But it appeared to be not so easy problem, because in general, there could be a few different correct sequences he could obtain, because the order in which the processes add the numbers is not strictly defined. Moreover, the processes can interrupt in between. For example, even if he had only two threads and for each of them, there was a list of 1 unique number, then there can be two valid orders: either the first thread added its' number first, or it was the second one. The another example could be the following: if there are also two thread, the first one having the list (1, 2) and the second one having the list (3, 4), then after doing all pops even the sequence (4, 2, 3, 1) is correct, because in this case: First, the first thread added the first number 1 from its' list; Then, the second thread added the first number 3 from its' list; Then, the first thread added the second number 2 from its' list; Then, the second thread added the second number 4 from its' list; So since it is a LIFO (last in, first out) stack, after the pops we get the sequence (4, 2, 3, 1). You are given the number of the threads and the list of integers to be added in order for each of the threads. You are also given a sequence. Determine, whether this sequence could be obtained after the process described above. Tags: Recursion, Memoization Algorithms ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/LFSTACK,CC

Chef and Filters ,"Nobody outside the cooking community knows that Chef is a big fan of Chefgram™ — a social network where chefs and cooks upload their secret kitchen photos. Recently Chef clicked a beautiful photo, which is represented using 10 pixels in a single row. Respecting Chefgram™'s boolean roots, every pixel is either white or black. Chefgram™ has N filters. Every filter is a string containing 10 symbols. Every symbol is either '+' or '-'. A '+' at the ith position in a filter means that if Chef applies this filter to his photo, the ith pixel will be inverted: it becomes black if it was originally white, and vice versa. A '-' at the ith position in a filter string means that if Chef applies this filter to his photo, the ith pixel will remain unchanged. Chef can apply as many filters as he wants from a list. He can pick any subset of filters and consequently apply them to a photo. For example: Imagine that Chef has a photo ""bbwwbbwwbb"" (where 'b' stands for black and 'w' stands for white). He applies filters ""++--++--++"", ""-+-+-+-+-+"". Applying the first filter will transform his picture to ""ww"". Applying the second filter on the transformed picture will give Chef the picture ""wbwbwbwbwb"". Even if Chefgram™ has two or more identical filters, they are still considered different! Chef is extremely interested in knowing how many different subsets of all the Chefgram™ filters can he apply to transform his photo into 10 black pixels?

Each group can be specified by two integers L and R (L ≤ R) with the meaning that the group contains all the elements from the Lth to the Rth one (both inclusive) in the given array. The cost of such a group equals to the value of bitwise OR of all elements in the group. The cost of array for some particular group division equals to the sum of costs for all the groups.

Launch Tower ,"""The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08 UTC (14:38 IST) on 5 November 2013"". The secret behind this successful launch was the launch pad that ISRO used. An important part of the launch pad is the launch tower. It is the long vertical structure which supports the rocket. ISRO now wants to build a better launch pad for their next mission. For this, ISRO has acquired a long steel bar, and the launch tower can be made by cutting a segment from the bar. As part of saving the cost, the bar they have acquired is not homogeneous. The bar is made up of several blocks, where the ith block has durability S[i], which is a number between 0 and 9. A segment is defined as any contiguous group of one or more blocks. If they cut out a segment of the bar from ith block to jth block (i<=j), then the durability of the resultant segment is given by ( S[i]*10(j-i) + S[i+1]*10(j-i-1) + S[i+2]*10(j-i-2) + … + S[j] * 10(0) ) % M. In other words, if W(i,j) is the base-10 number formed by concatenating the digits S[i], S[i+1], S[i+2], …, S[j], then the durability of the segment (i,j) is W(i,j) % M. For technical reasons that ISRO will not disclose, the durability of the segment used for building the launch tower should be exactly L. Given S and M, find the number of ways ISRO can cut out a segment from the steel bar whose durability is L.

Chef and Magic Arrays ,"Yesterday Chef had cooked N very tasty dishes. A dish is prepared of several ingredients.

Of course, this is not valid for the N-th dish, as it's the last dish. Overall quality of these dishes will be calculated as follows. Consider dish i and i + 1, if the last ingredient of dish i be of tastiness x, and the first ingredient of dish i + 1 of tastiness of y, then the quality of dish will be increased by |x - y| * i, where (|t| denotes the absolute value of t).

If she buys the ith item in one shop, she gets a discount coupon for the i+1th item in the same shop. But if she purchases the i+1th item from a different shop, she cannot use the discount coupon. For example, if she buys the ith item in Shop j and gets a discount of X rupees. Let the price of i+1th item be Y rupees in shop j and Z rupees in shop k. If she purchases the i+1th item from shop j she can use the discount coupon and hence, will have to pay Y-X rupees.

Inversion sorting ,"The Aa'ugld alphabet consists of M letters, which we'll denote by integers from 1 to M in alphabetical order - the smaller number a letter has, the earlier it appears in the alphabet. Since the author of this alphabet wasn't very creative, many letters can be transformed to other ones using some simple operations, which we'll call ""inversions"". You're given a list of possible operations. The list isn't exhaustive, since any two inversions can be combined to produce a new inversion. Specifically, if there is an inversion that transforms a letter x to a letter y and an inversion that transforms the letter y to a letter z, you may assume that there's also an inversion that transforms the letter x to the letter z. In short, ""inversion"" operations are transitive. Combining any inversion with itself produces identity - an operation that transforms any letter to itself. (That's where the name ""inversion"" comes from - an operation that's its own inverse.) Therefore, if there's an inversion that transforms a letter x to a letter y, then there's also an inversion that transforms the letter y to the letter x. There's a long word W with N letters. You should transform some of these letters to other ones in order to make the letters of W sorted in alphabetical order. Is it possible at all?

Chef and Bracket-Pairs ,"Chef loves brackets. So much so, that rather than just use plain brackets like (), {}, or [], he has invented his own notation that allows him to use many more types of brackets. Each type of bracket is designated by an integer. A negative integer -x represents an opening bracket of type x; while a positive integer x represents a closing bracket of type x. Any sequence of such integers is then called a bracket-pair sequence. A balanced bracket-pair sequence can be defined recursively as follows: The empty sequence is a balanced bracket-pair sequence. If S is a balanced bracket-pair sequence, then -x S x is a balanced bracket-pair sequence for any positive integer x. If S and T are balanced bracket-pair sequences, then S T is a balanced bracket-pair sequence. For example, ""-1 -2 2 -3 -4 4 3 1"" is a balanced bracket-pair sequence, but ""-1 -2 1 2"" is not.

The nanobots can form a powerful laser with force F and shoot this laser horizontally from the left or from the right of any row, or vertically from the top or from the bottom of any column. Whenever the laser is fired, it breaks through the maximum number of cells in its way such that the total thickness of these cells' membranes is less than or equal to F and destroys them; the cells that lie behind them are unaffected. Formally, if the laser destroys C cells, then they are the first C cells which lie in the laser's way (from the direction in which it is fired), haven't been destroyed before, and the sum of thicknesses of their membranes is at most F. The laser may be fired multiple times from any directions in any rows or columns. It may also be fired repeatedly in the same direction and the same row or column. However, each shot uses a lot of the nanobots' energy, so Ada wants to destroy all cells using as few shots as possible. Let H be the minimum number of shots needed to destroy all cells when using only horizontal shots, and V the minimum number of shots needed to destroy all cells when using only vertical shots. Ada programmed the nanobots to perform K=min(V,H)K=min(V,H)K = mathrm{min}(V,H) shots. Help Ada write a program that uses a strictly smaller number of shots.

Lucky Driving ,"""Nine is considered a good number in Chinese culture because it sounds the same as the word ""long-lasting"". Hence many people want their car registration numbers to sum up to 9 on adding the digits recursively. A car registration number can consist of 1,2,3 or 4 digits. Examples of some good car numbers are 63, 018, 9099, etc. whereas 12,129 are not good. Why is 9099 good? 9+0+9+9 = 27 2+7 = 9 Similarly it is not difficult to see why 63, 018, 69, 99… are good."" Given a string of digits, print how many subsequences of the string result in good car registration numbers.

Beautiful Subsequence ,"An array A consisting of N integers is called K-beautiful if it holds the following property: The number of adjacent indices with different values is at most K. More formally, there are at most K indices i (1≤i<N1≤i<N1le ilt N) such that Ai≠Ai+1Ai≠Ai+1A_ine A_{i+1}. Note that according to this definition, if an array A is K-beautiful, then A is also (K+1)(K+1)(K+1)-beautiful. You are given an array A consisting of N integers and an integer K. Find the length of the longest K-beautiful subsequence of A, where a subsequence is defined below. For example, consider the array A=[1,1,2,3,2,4]A=[1,1,2,3,2,4]A = [1 , 1, 2, 3, 2 , 4]. The subsequences [1,1][1,1][1, 1] and [1,1,2][1,1,2][1, 1, 2] are 1-beautiful, and the subsequences [1,2,3][1,2,3][1, 2, 3] and [1,2,2,4][1,2,2,4][1, 2, 2, 4] are 2-beautiful. Note: A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, [3,1][3,1][3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1][3,2,1][3,2,1] and [4,3,1][4,3,1][4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7][1,3,3,7][1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4][3,10,4][3,10,4].

Mountain Holidays 2 ,"Let’s remember the problem Mountain holidays (MOU1H). The story of Mountain holidays is the following. Some time ago, Chef discovered that more and more people have started climbing mountains every day. So he decided to build a restaurant in the Ukrainian resort Bukovel (Carpathian Mountains). But there are many places to choose, so he wants to choose the best one. By your great helps, Chef could find to the best place to build a restaurant, now Chef becomes rich. Now he wants to build a restaurant in the next mountain. Similar to previous one, the next mountain is described by a sequence of N points. Here the points are numbered from 1 to N, and the height of point k is denoted by Hk. Every two adjacent points of the mountain are connected by a segment. For example, the mountain described by N = 9, H = [0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0] is like a following: / ///  / / In the mountain, all of the tourists will go from the point 1 to point N. For comfort of the tourists, Chef has bought teleports too. Using a teleport, a tourist can be transferred from point i to point j, for all i < j. Of course, tourists can also walk from point i to point i+1 on foot. Now Chef wants to calculate the attractiveness of the mountain, as the number of the different climbs. A climb is defined by the nonempty sequence (p1, p1+1), (p2, p2+1), ., (ps, ps+1) of the moves on foot , where pk+1 ≤ pk+1 for k = 1, 2, ., s − 1. Two climbs, say (p1, p1+1), (p2, p2+1), ., (ps, ps+1) and (q1, q1+1), (q2, q2+1), ., (qt, qt+1) are different if and only if s ≠ t or There exists at least one k such that 1 ≤ k < min(s, t) and Hpk+1 – Hpk ≠ Hqk+1 – Hqk. You are given the array H, find the number of the different climbs that exist on the mountain. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo 109+9 = 1009.

Chef and Gift ,"Chef likes cooking. But more than that, he likes to give gifts. And now he wants to give his girlfriend an unforgettable gift. But unfortunately he forgot the password to the safe where the money he saved for the gift is kept. But he knows how to hack the safe. To do this, you need to correctly answer questions asked by the embedded computer. The computer is very strange, and asks special questions, sometimes it can ask about 100 question (really weird). Because of this, Chef wants you to write a program that will help him to crack the safe. The questions are different, but there is only one type of question. Several numbers are given and between them one of three characters: *, +, - can be inserted. Note that in this case there is no priority for the operators, that is, if + is the before multiplication, you must first execute the operation of addition, and then multiplication (1 - 2 * 3 must be interpreted as (1 - 2) * 3 = -3 and not -5). The computer asks the minimum possible value of any valid expression. Tags: DP Approach Algorithms, Dynamic Programming ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/CHGIFT1,CC

Expected Change ,"Chef has a string A with length N. It contains only characters '(', ')' and '*'. Chef wants to perform the following process: Uniformly randomly choose a pair of integers (l,r)(l,r)(l, r) such that 1≤l≤r≤N1≤l≤r≤N1 le l le r le N. Consider the substring S=[Al,Al+1,…,Ar]S=[Al,Al+1,…,Ar]S = [A_l, A_{l+1}, ldots, A_r]. Process the characters of this string from left to right. Let's denote the current number of closing brackets in S up to the currently processed character (inclusive) by ncncn_c. Similarly, let's denote the number of opening brackets by nonon_o. Note that the string S may change; ncncn_c and nonon_o correspond to the current state of S, not its initial state. Whenever ncncn_c becomes greater than nonon_o, the currently processed character must be ')'. Then, change it from ')' to '(' and continue processing the remaining characters of S. Chef would like to know the expected number of characters that he would change in this process. Can you help him? It can be proved that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction P/QP/QP/Q, where P and Q are non-negative integers and Q is coprime to 109+7109+710^9+7. You should find P⋅Q−1P⋅Q−1P cdot Q^{-1} modulo 109+7109+710^9+7, where Q−1Q−1Q^{-1} denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 109+7109+710^9+7.

Vertices are numbered independently in each layer by integers from 0 to m - 1. For each pair of vertices which are in the adjacent layers (i and i + 1 for any i (0 <= i <= n)), there exists an edge. The vertex which is in the layer with smaller number is the initial vertex for such edge and the other one is the terminal vertex. Based on a graph as described above, Chef added k more edges. Each edge connects two vertices which are in the different layers, no matter the adjacent layers or not. Also, each edge is directed from left to right (as well as all previously existing edges).

A subsequence of a number is a sequence of digits that can be derived from the number by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) digits without changing the order of the remaining digits. The subsequence may even start with trailing zeros. For example 101010, 010101 are subsequences of 101101101 while 110110110 is NOT a subsequence of 101101101. Note that there are 8 subsequences of 101101101. The subsequence 1 appears twice and should be counted as different while computing the sum.

Even Sequence ,"An even sequence has the following property: each maximal contiguous subsequence which contains only equal integers (i.e. the same integer repeated a number of times) has an even length. In particular, the empty sequence is even. A subsequence is maximal if it is not contained in a larger contiguous subsequence which contains only equal integers. Chef was given an integer sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,ANA_1, A_2, ldots, A_N by his friend Mr. Z. He may perform the following operation any number of times: either delete an element of the current sequence (if it is non-empty) or insert an integer anywhere in the current sequence (possibly at the beginning or at the end).

(Challenge) Dynamic Hull ,"There are N points in a plane (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the coordinates of the i-th point are (Xi,Yi)(Xi,Yi)(X_i,Y_i). We want to remove all the points one by one; you should choose the order in which they are removed. Whenever a point is removed, we compute the area of the convex hull of the remaining points. Then, we define a penalty P as twice the sum of all these areas. It can be proved that P is an integer. Let M be the penalty of an algorithm that always greedily chooses the point that minimises the area of the convex hull of the remaining points (if there is more than one such point, the point with the smallest X-coordinate is chosen; if there is still more than one point, then the point with the smallest Y-coordinate is chosen). You are given this penalty. Your goal is to find a removal order that results in a smaller penalty.

Robot Walk ,"Chef has recently learned robotics and has now been able to construct a robot that's much better than his robots from last year. It's still somewhat limited, but it's definitely more flexible than before. Here are its properties: The robot can only move forward towards the direction it faces, and can only face either horizontally or vertically. The robot can only turn at 90 degree angles. The robot is designed to turn exactly N times. In addition, this robot is programmable. You can feed it 2N+1 values: a0, f1, a1, f2, a2, ., fN, aN, where each ai is a positive integer and each fi is either L or R, and then it will perform the following actions: Initially face north. Move forward by a0 steps. If f1 is L, turn left 90 degrees; if f1 is R, turn right 90 degrees. Move forward by a1 steps. If f2 is L, turn left 90 degrees; if f2 is R, turn right 90 degrees. Move forward by a2 steps. . If fN is L, turn left 90 degrees; if fN is R, turn right 90 degrees. Move forward by aN steps. Now, Chef wants to test his new robot. Chef has already prepared the 2N+1 values to feed to the robot. However, Chef is very lazy and doesn't want to move, so he wants the robot to return to its starting point exactly. To do so, he can change some of the values, but some changes need time. Specifically, Chef can increase or decrease any ai by 1, but this takes 1 second. Also, this change is only allowed if the new ai value is positive. Chef can replace any fi by L or R. This takes 0 seconds. Now, Chef wants to know the minimum number of seconds he needs to accomplish this task. Since Chef is lazy, he asks you to solve this problem for him.

Digits Cannot Separate ,"Mr. Wilson was planning to record his new Progressive Rock music album called ""Digits. Cannot. Separate"". Xenny and PowerShell, popular pseudo-number-theoreticists from the Land of Lazarus were called by him to devise a strategy to ensure the success of this new album. Xenny and Powershell took their Piano Lessons and arrived at the Studio in different Trains. Mr. Wilson, creative as usual, had created one single, long music track S. The track consisted of N musical notes. The beauty of each musical note was represented by a decimal digit from 0 to 9. Mr. Wilson told them that he wanted to create multiple musical tracks out of this long song. Since Xenny and Powershell were more into the number theory part of music, they didn’t know much about their real workings. Mr. Wilson told them that a separator could be placed between 2 digits. After placing separators, the digits between 2 separators would be the constituents of this new track and the number formed by joining them together would represent the Quality Value of that track. He also wanted them to make sure that no number formed had greater than M digits. Mr. Wilson had Y separators with him. He wanted Xenny and PowerShell to use at least X of those separators, otherwise he would have to ask them to Drive Home. Xenny and PowerShell knew straight away that they had to put place separators in such a way that the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of all the Quality Values would eventually determine the success of this new album. Hence, they had to find a strategy to maximize the GCD. If you find the maximum GCD of all Quality Values that can be obtained after placing the separators, Xenny and PowerShell shall present you with a Porcupine Tree. Note: You can read about GCD here.

Super Hashing ,"Hash functions are primarily used to generate fixed-length output data that acts as a shortened reference to the original data. This is useful when the original data is too cumbersome to use in its entirety.One practical use is a data structure called a hash table where the data is stored associatively. Searching linearly for a person's name in a list becomes cumbersome as the length of the list increases, but the hashed value can be used to store a reference to the original data and retrieve constant time (barring collisions). It involves mapping an element into a numerical value using some mathematical function. In this problem we will consider a simple hash system. It involves assigning numerical value to the alphabets and summing these values of the characters. For example, the string “acm” is mapped to 1+3+13=171+3+13=171 + 3 + 13 = 17. Unfortunately, this method does not give one-to-one mapping. The string “adl” also maps to 171717 (1+4+12)(1+4+12)(1 + 4 + 12). This is called collision. In this problem you will have to find the number of strings of length L, which maps to an integer S, using the above hash function. You have to consider strings that have only lowercase letters and uppercase letters in strictly ascending order. NB: all lowercase letters are smaller than all uppercase letters: Example: ‘z’ < ‘A’ Suppose L=3L=3L = 3 and S=10S=10S = 10, there are 4 such strings:(abg , acf , ade , bce ) agb also produces 10 but the letters are not strictly in ascending order. bh also produces 101010 but it has 2 letters.

Chef and Soccer ,"Chef is a big fan of soccer! He loves soccer so much that he even invented soccer for dogs! Here are the rules of soccer for dogs: N dogs (numbered 1 through N) stand in a line in such a way that for each valid i, dogs i and i+1i+1i + 1 are adjacent. Each dog has a skill level, which is either 1 or 2. At the beginning of the game, Chef passes a ball to dog 1 (dog 1 receives the ball). For each valid i, if dog i has skill level s, this dog can pass the ball to any dog with number j such that 1≤|i−j|≤s1≤|i−j|≤s1 le |i-j| le s. Each dog (including dog 1) may receive the ball at most once. Whenever a dog receives the ball, it must either pass it to another dog or finish the game by scoring a goal. While the dogs were playing, Chef also created a game for developers. He defined the result of a game of soccer for dogs as the sequence of dogs which received the ball in the order in which they received it. The last dog in the sequence is the dog that decided to score a goal; if a dog never received the ball, it does not appear in the sequence. In the game for developers, you should find the number of possible results of soccer for dogs. Find this number of possible results modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7. Two results of soccer for dogs (sequences of dogs' numbers) are considered different if these sequences have different lengths or if there is a valid index i such that the i-th dog in one sequence is different from the i-th dog in the other sequence.

Method Resolution Order ,"Zotlin is an object-oriented programming language that provides features such as Classes and Functions. Zotlin also has the following features: A function with the same name and same declarations can have different implementations in different classes. Each class can inherit zero or more classes (excluding itself). If Class A inherits Class B, we say that Class A is a child of Class B. A class cannot inherit another class if a cycle is formed by inheritance. For example, if Class A inherits Class B and Class B inherits Class C, then Class C cannot inherit Class A. A Class X is called an ancestor of Class Y, if Y inherits directly or indirectly from Class X. ie, say Class Y inherits from Class Z, which inherits from Class X. Then Class X is an ancestor of both Class Y and Class Z. Mr. Zourist — a very popular programmer — wrote a program in Zotlin with N classes numbered from 1 to N. Some of these classes have an implementation of a function F. The Zotlin compiler needs to determine which definition of function F should be called for an object of Class 1. In order to deterministically decide which implementation of function F to use, the compiler uses a list called the Resolution Order (RO list). This is a list containing Class 1 and its ancestors. The compiler iterates through this list to search for a class that contains an implementation of function F. The properties of an RO list are as follows: The 1st member of the list is Class 1. The list contains only the ancestors of Class 1. All the Classes in the list are unique. It is guaranteed that no Class occurs after any of its ancestors in the list. Let's define the Special RO list as an RO list of length N where the ith member in the list is Class i. That is, the Special RO list is [1, 2, 3, . , N]. Find out the number of distinct class-inheritance hierarchies Mr. Zourist could have created in his program for which one of the valid RO lists is the Special RO list. Print your output modulo 109 + 7. Two class-inheritance hierarchies are considered different if they have at least one class that inherits a different list of classes.

Candy Collecting Game ,"Alice and Bob have come to spend their day in a FunFair which is close to their house. They have played almost all games and seen all the attractions. But there's one game left which has caught their attention. The winner of this game could get a LOT of candies! The game is as follows: The game is a two-player game which is played on an NxM grid. Each cell of the grid has a certain number of candies. A[i][j] denotes the number of candies in the jth column of the ith row. The players make alternate turns. In each turn, a player must remove one complete row or one complete column from the grid. He will add all the candies in that row/column into his account. The only possible rows that a player can remove in his/her turn are the top row or the bottom row. Similarly, only leftmost column or the rightmost column can be removed in one turn. After removing the row or column, the game is played on the new reduced grid with one less row or column respectively. When the entire matrix is emptied, the player with higher number of candies wins the game and can take all those candies with him/her. The loser has to give back the candies collected so far and return empty-handed. If both players have equal number of candies, both of them are declared winners. Alice and Bob want to take as many candies home as possible. They don't have much time with themselves. So they come up with a strategy using which they want to increase Bob's share of candies and decrease Alice's share. This way, they plan to make Bob win and take his entire share of candies! The strategy is as follows: Alice decides to pick the row or column from the present grid which has the least number of candies in every turn of hers. If there are more than one such options, then her order of preference will be: 1) first row 2) last row 3) first column 4) last column. For example, if all these 4 rows/columns have the same number of candies, she will remove the first row in this turn. Bob chooses an optimal strategy through which he maximizes his share of candies in the end of the game. Note that Bob's strategy maximizes the number of his candies, not winner's candies. Also note that Bob knows Alice's strategy, of course, and he will take into account her strategy when he decides his move. It's quite evident that their strategy is not optimal. It might happen that Bob loses a game. And sometimes, both might win (with equal number of candies).

Jump mission ,"There are N hills arranged in a row, and each of them is assigned a unique index from 1 to N — the ith hill has an index Pi on it. The height of the ith hill is Hi.

When chief is on the ith hill, he has to prepare a special dish for the community of that hill as a thanks for letting him use their resources. This will cost him Ai energy (some dishes are chief's favorites and preparing it refreshes chef that why Ai may be negative).

Dividing Products ,"Dr. Bobo, while working in his laboratory, thought of an interesting problem. He has spent considerable time trying to find a solution but in vain. So he turns to you to find the solution using your special powers of coding. For a positive integer N, he defines a function DIVPRO(N) as follows. Let N be L-digit number and ni is the i-th digit in the decimal representation of N (i = 1, 2, ., L). So we can write N = n1n2.nL. Then DIVPRO(N) = n1 / n2 * n3 / n4 * . (i.e., we alternate division and multiplication of digits). The result is calculated from left to right. Division here is performed in standard mathematical way, so the result of the division can be non-integer number. If division by 0 occurs at any point for a given N, then DIVPRO(N) is undefined in such a case. Let's consider some examples: DIVPRO(1) = 1. In fact, DIVPRO(N) = N for any 1-digit number N. DIVPRO(42) = 4 / 2 = 2 is an integer. DIVPRO(123) = 1 / 2 * 3 = 3 / 2 = 1.5 is non-integer. DIVPRO(370) = 3 / 7 * 0 = 0, while intermediate result was 3 / 7 which is non-integer. DIVPRO(3465009) = 3 / 4 * 6 / 5 * 0 / 0 * 9 is undefined since we have division by zero. Now Dr. Bobo would like to know how many L-digit numbers have their DIVPRO value equal to V and he wants your help. Since this number can be quite large output it modulo 232, that is, you need to find the remainder of the division of the answer by 232.

Sergey also lives in ChefLand. He wants to seal the window in his house. The window has the shape of a simple convex polygon with N vertices. For the sealing, there are M kinds of sticky stripes, which are sold in the shops. The stripe of the ith type has the length of Li millimeters and the cost of Ci rubles. The sealing process consists in picking the stripe and sticking it on the border of the window. The stripe can't be cut (it is made of very lasting material) and can only be put straight, without foldings. It is not necessary to put the strip strictly on the window border, it can possibly extend outside the border side of window too (by any possible amount). The window is considered sealed up if every point on its' border is covered with at least one stripe. Now Sergey is curious about the stripes he needs to buy. He wonders about the cheapest cost, at which he can seal his window. Please help him.

Reign 2 ,"Crueland is a dangerous region following ancient traditions. Every day, there are confrontations among local rulers, and thus many civilians are forced to be refugees. The only recognized way of resolving issues in Crueland is by means of physical power. King George is thought to be one of the most reasonable and careful rulers in Crueland. As a reasonable ruler, he understands that the best defense is a good offense. Therefore, he decided to conquer some castles and lands to frighten his enemies. There are N castles that can be conquered by George. As a careful ruler, he won't let his people die without a strong reason. After careful solitary consideration, he has decided to conquer exactly K castles during the next K days, an aim he plans to achieve by conquering one castle every day for the next K days. As reported by King George's spies, Ai + (j - 1) × Bi enemy knights will be protecting the ith castle during the jth day. When attacking a castle, if the King sends as many knights as those defending it, it's sufficient to be conquer that castle. Another requirement is that one knight cannot be sent to conquer two different castles. Now, you are the Hand of the King. Though caring about the King is your duty, you know that he is a tyrant and you want people to learn the truth about him. Thus, you want to sabotage George's military campaign: maximize the total number of knights used during all the conquests. In this way, his subjects will learn that he doesn't care about them too much. As you are the king's trusted advisor, you can choose a set of K castles, that the king should conquer. George trusts you enough, so you are assured that he will conquer exactly the set of castles you chose. After you provide a set of castles, George will choose the order in which he will conquer them. You can assume that George always chooses the order which minimizes the total number of knights used during all the conquests. Your task is to find the maximum possible total number of knights that can be used during the campaign and reached by delegating a set of K castles to conquer. Also, you are not sure about the value of K, so you should find the optimal answer for each K = 1, 2, . , N.

Completing favorite game ,"Chef has a nice job. Actually he doesn't even remember what he is supposed to do there, because he just plays video-games all the time, exactly h hours every working day! Recently he got bored of just randomly playing video-games and decided to complete all the levels of his favorite Game as fast as possible. The Game consists of n levels numbered with integers from 1 to n. After completing every level, some small number of new levels is unlocked. The structure of the Game levels is a tree with the root in level 1, i.e. every level (except for 1) has a unique level that unlocks it and level 1 is the only level that is considered unlocked at the very beginning. Chef has completed his favorite Game lots of times, so he knows that he needs exactly ti hours to complete level i. Due to specifics of the Game every level should be completed entirely within one working day, i.e. Chef cannot start a level on Thursday, and finish it Friday morning. Overall the game-play proceeds as follows: There is a stack S that initially contains only the level 1 Chef pops the topmost level out of the stack. Let's call this level x Chef spends tx hours to complete level x. Note that he doesn't want to stay at work longer than for h hours, so if there is not enough time left today Chef will complete level x the next working day morning. After completing level x some mx new levels get unlocked Chef places all the mx unlocked levels on the top of the stack S in an arbitrary order, i.e. he is free to choose any order he likes If stack S is empty, the Game is considered completed, otherwise Chef goes back to the step 2 Can you help Chef figure out the minimum number of working days necessary to complete the Game?

Too Much Sweetness ,"Raghav studies in NSIT and is bored of the regular hostel mess food. For a change he went to a sweet shop at City Centre near the college to have some sweets. There he found only two boxes containing sweets; box 1 contains p sweets and box 2 contains q sweets. Initially, both boxes are closed. Raghav wants to eat exactly N sweets in total during the following process: Choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ 2) of one box and a number s (0 < s ≤ number of sweets in box i). Open box i, take out s sweets, eat them and then close box i. Write down number i exactly s times. If less than N sweets have been eaten in total, repeat from the first step. The index i of the box chosen at each step should always be different from the index of the previously selected box. In the beginning, either box can be chosen. At the end, Raghav will have written down a sequence P1, P2, P3, ., PN (1 ≤ Pi ≤ 2 for each valid i) describing the boxes containing the sweets he ate, in the given order. For example, if he has to eat N = 7 sweets, so he opens box 1 and takes out 3 sweets and then opens box 2 and takes out 4 sweets, then the sequence P1..N will be 122. In addition, Raghav cannot eat more than Si sweets from box i in one step (s ≤ Si). Also, box i cannot be opened more than Bi times in total. Can you help Raghav determine the total number of possible sequences P1..N satisfying the given constraints? Since this number can be large, compute it modulo 109 + 7.

Then,Shaun should report to his teacher the number of ways he can arrange all 2∗N2∗N2*N brackets such that sequence form is valid. Teacher defined valid sequence by these rules: Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'. Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('. Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'. Note: Shaun could match opening and closing brackets of different colours. Since number of ways can be large, Shaun would report the answer as modulo 1007 (109+7109+710^9 + 7).

Now he consider all girls as nodes of a directed graph. If one girl has an edge directed towards another girl, the former tells all the secrets she knows to the latter. Edges are oriented, so if one girl is sharing secrets with another, it doesn't imply the same relation in the reverse direction. Also, there are no cycles in the graph. Each girl (except Chef's crush) has only one edge emanating from her, or doesn't have any edges emanating from her at all. Each girl listens to at most one girl. In other words, for each girl, there is only one girl who reveals secrets to her, or there are no such girls at all. Each edge has two integers assigned to it, specifying the range of interest. If girl A knows secrets in the range [10-20] and an edge directed towards girl B with a range of interest [2-15] then girl B will know secrets in the range [10-15], which is, evidently, an intersection of the range of secrets and the interest range. Chef's crush has all the [1-32] secrets, other girls just listen to her and then gossip around (share those secrets). If a girl doesn't have an edge emanating from her, she tells all the secrets she knows to Chef.

Grid Path ,"There is a grid containing N rows and N columns. The cell at the ithithi^{th} row from the top and jthjthj^{th} column from the left is a passable space if Si,jSi,jS_{i,j} is '.' and a blocked cell if Si,jSi,jS_{i,j} is '#'. Chef is at the top-left cell and wants to reach the bottom-right cell. Chef can move one cell down, or right to a passable cell. He can't leave the grid. If Chef is at the cell (i,j)(i,j)(i,j), he can collect Ai,jAi,jA_{i,j} coins. Now, Chef has a special ability using which he can make all the blocked cells in a path of length K into passable cells. Chef uses this ability before moving from the top-left cell. It is possible that some of the cells in the chosen K length path are already passable. More formally, Chef can choose a sequence of K cells such that for each i (1≤i<K)(1≤i<K)(1 leq i lt K), the ithithi^{th} and (i+1)th(i+1)th(i+1)^{th} cells of the sequence are adjacent and make all these K cells passable. Find the maximum amount of coins Chef can collect in the path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell. Print −1−1-1 if it is impossible to reach the bottom-right cell. Note: Two cells are considered to be adjacent if they share a common side. The cell (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) has four adjacent cells i.e. the cells (i−1,j)(i−1,j)(i - 1, j), (i+1,j)(i+1,j)(i + 1, j), (i,j−1)(i,j−1)(i, j - 1) and (i,j+1)(i,j+1)(i, j + 1). It is guaranteed that the top-left cell of the grid is a passable cell. Tags: Dynamic Programming Algorithms ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/GRIDPA,CC

Professor on a Trip ,"The Professor is going on a trip with his family this weekend. The country where they live is a federation of N states (numbered 1 through N) with R bidirectional interstate roads connecting them. For each road, we know the amount of fuel the Professor needs to traverse it; travelling within a state consumes no fuel. For each i, the price of fuel in state i is fixed at FiFiF_i units of money per litre. Despite Professor's outstanding talent and his great scientific prowess, he has some bad habits as well: he is too penny-wise, so he carries huge barrels in his car in order to store extra petrol and avoid buying petrol in expensive states. Therefore, he is able to carry any amount of fuel he wants at any moment during the trip, and he is also fine with visiting the same state more than once on the trip if it saves him money. The Professor starts the trip without any fuel. Help the Professor find the minimum possible amount of money he should spend on fuel in order to travel from state P to state Q.

Sereja and Game ,"Sereja and Dima play the game. The rules are as follows: Initially, there are n cards on the table, each card has a positive integer written on it. At the beginning Sereja writes down the number 0 on the sheet of paper. Then players pick cards from the table alternately. When a player picks a card, he writes down the greatest common divisor of a number that is written on a card and a number that was last written on the sheet of paper. Then the player throws this card away, so it can never been taken again. A player loses if after his turn the number, written on the piece of the paper is 1. A player also loses, if he isn't able to make a move. Now Sereja is interested in the following two things: what is the probability of Sereja's victory if he makes the first move and the both players play optimaly what is the probability of Sereja's victory if he makes the first move and the both players make moves randomly If player makes moves randomly, he chooses a card with equal probability among those that remained on the table.

Jimma and Chingam ,"Jimma the cat had placed N bowls of cat food in a line. The amount of food in each bowl is an integer and is given to you as the array A[1], A[2], . , A[N], where A[1] is the amount of food in the leftmost bowl, and A[N] is the amount in the rightmost bowl. But Chingam the kitten doesn't like unsorted sequences. In general, for an arbitrary sequence B[1], B[2], . , B[N], Chingam's unhappiness is defined as the number of inversions in that sequence. That is, unhappiness = number of pairs (i,j), such that i < j and B[i] > B[j]. Now, Chingam wants to take the bowls from the old line and create a new line with them, possibly re-ordered, so that his unhappiness is minimized. ie. let's say that after re-ordering, the bowls form the sequence P[1], P[2], . , P[N]. That is, P[1] is the amount of food in the leftmost bowl of the new line and P[N] is the amount of food in the rightmost bowl of the new line. Then he wants to minimize his unhappiness with respect to this array P. Note that P[1], P[2], . , P[N] will be a permutation of A[1], A[2], . , A[N]. But he follows a peculiar method to build the new line (which is initially empty) from the old line of bowls. He takes one bowl at a time from the old line and places it in the new line. Due to the limitations of his paws, Chingam can only pick a bowl which is the current leftmost or rightmost in the old line for each step. And he can place it only at the current right or left end of the new line. By doing this, Chingam gets a new sequence P[1], P[2], . , P[N]. He wants to minimize his unhappiness with respect to this new sequence. Find out the minimum unhappiness that Chingam has to bear.

Expected GCD ,"Chef loves to make dishes. Currently, he has N ingredients (numbered 1 through N) which he can use to cook various dishes. To make a dish, Chef must use exactly K ingredients in a correct order. Therefore, a dish is a sequence of K distinct integers between 1 and N. The tastiness of that dish is defined as the GCD of these integers (all the ingredients in that dish). Chef wants to choose a dish uniformly randomly and cook it. You should answer Q queries. K is the same for all queries. In each query, you are given N and you should find the expected value of the tastiness of Chef's dish or determine that Chef cannot cook any dish. If Chef can cook at least one dish, it can be proven that this expected value is a fraction in the form P/DP/DP/D, where P and D are coprime positive integers and D is coprime with 109+7109+710^9+7. You should compute P⋅D−1P⋅D−1P cdot D^{-1} modulo 109+7109+710^9+7, where D−1D−1D^{-1} denotes the multiplicative inverse of D modulo 109+7109+710^9+7.

Cosmic Temple ,"Nearly 109+7109+710^{9} + 7 trillion kilometers far away from the Milkyway, there exists a parallel Universe of Light called the Cosmos of Solon where each planet is called a Temple. There are total N temples. Unlike humans, the Solomons (Giant aliens of the Light World) can travel from one temple to another through Cosmic Bridges and the distance observed by them between any two temples is 0 units (Interesting? Well, they travel with more than the speed of light) But the year 202020202020, proved to be a curse for Solomons. This year, a Mega Star Urus struck their Universe and damaged many Cosmic Bridges. However the God of Light ensured that for any two distinct temples u and v there exists exactly one unique path through Cosmic Bridge(s), but the distance between two directly connected temples through a Bridge has now increased to 1 units. To prevail the existence of this Universe, the God of Light carved himself into exactly N Solomons which now rule the N temples and are independent of each other. One by one, the ithithi^{th} Solomon (0≤i≤N−10≤i≤N−10 leq i leq N-1) transmits Light pulses through the network of Cosmic Bridges and determines the sum of distances to the remaining N−1N−1N-1 Solomons.

Favourite Numbers ,"Chef likes numbers and number theory, we all know that. There are N digit strings that he particularly likes. He likes them so much that he defines some numbers to be beautiful numbers based on these digit strings. Beautiful numbers are those numbers whose decimal representation contains at least one of chef's favorite digit strings as a substring. Your task is to calculate the Kth smallest number amongst the beautiful numbers in the range from L to R (both inclusive). If the number of beautiful numbers between L and R is less than K, then output ""no such number"".

Flash vs QuickSilver ,"Flash and QuickSilver challenge each other to a faceoff. They stand at the top of a huge staircase where the steps are numbered from n down to 1. In a single step, they can step down from stair n to stair n-1. Afraid of losing the challenge, flash bribes the judge and figures out a few tricks. If the stair number n is divisible by 2, he can jump directly to stair numbered n/2 in a single step. If the stair number n is divisble by 3, Flash can then jump directly to stair numbered n/3 in a single step. In order to win, one needs to reach the stair numbered 1, in minimum time. Assuming that both of them can take 1 step in 1 sec, calculate the minimum time required by Flash to reach the stair numbered 1.

Maximize the Tax ,"Nikitas does not want to study for his exams, so he decided to become a disruptor and get a part-time job as a tax collector in Airland. Airland consists of N houses (numbered 1 through N) and M one-way supply pathways that connect them. Each house has a budget; let's denote the budget of house i by BiBiB_i (in coins). The neighbourhood of a house is the set of houses which both can supply this house and can be supplied from this house. (directly or indirectly, including itself) Nikitas can choose to start his tax-collecting journey at any house. Then, he can move along supply pathways to visit more houses and collect taxes on the way. For each valid i, when Nikitas visits house i for the first time (including the house where he starts the journey), but hasn't visited any house in the neighbourhood of house i before, then he must choose a positive integer c and announce to each house in this neighbourhood that it should pay c coins in taxes. Whenever a house with a budget b is asked to pay c coins, two things can happen. If c≤bc≤bc le b, this house pays the tax. If c>bc>bc gt b, this house cannot afford to pay the tax, so it does not pay anything. Note that no house may be asked to pay taxes twice. When the houses that can afford to pay the announced tax pay it, Nikitas can continue his journey in the same way until he cannot collect any more money. He has to be careful, though ― at the end, if there are more than K houses that were asked to pay their tax, but did not pay because they could not afford it, the captain of Airland will take his katana and capture Nikitas, so he will end his tax-collecting journey without earning any money. Otherwise, Nikitas earns all the money he collected. Nikitas wants to maximise the amount of money he will make. Luckily, you know all the information about the supply pathways in Airland, so you offer to help Nikitas calculate the maximum amount of money he can make without getting captured. Since this number may be large, compute it modulo 102110211021 (109+21109+2110^9 + 21).

TWO SACKS OF HAPPINESS ,"It is the last day of covid and you are coming back to your home with two empty sacks. On the way to your home, you found Ambani brothers donating all their wealth in form of coins after getting fed up with all the money they have. The coins have both positive and negative values and they are laid down in a line. Now as you don’t want to go with an empty sack so you also decided to take some of the money being given by Ambani’s. But anyone who wants the money has to follow a rule that he/she can choose an only contiguous segment of coins which are lying in a line (you can also imagine it like an array of coins) whether its value is positive or negative. Formally according to the rule if you are given an array [-1,2,3,4,2,0] you can only choose subarrays like [2,3], [4,2,0], [-1] , [-1,2,3,4,2,0] etc. Now as you have two siblings you decided to fill both the sacks with some coins. Your task is to choose the coins in such a way that the sum of values of all the coins(including sacks 1 and 2) is maximum and both sacks are non-empty. For e.g.: If the array of coins is: -1 2 3 4 -3 -5 6 7 1 Following are some ways you can choose the coins: 2 3 4 and -5 6 7 -1 2 3 and 6 7 1 2 3 4 and 6 7 1 and so on…. You can see that among the given ways the 3rd way will yield maximum values (2+3+4) + (6+7+1)=23 Note: Both the sack should be non-empty. A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. An array that is inside another array. A coin can be inserted in one and only one sacks i.e you cannot choose a coin more than one time.

Chef and Pepperoni Pizza Again ,"Chef is fond of pepperoni pizza, as we saw here. Once again, he has a pepperoni pizza in the shape of a grid with N rows (numbered 1 through N from top to bottom) and N columns (numbered 1 through N from left to right). Some cells of this grid contain pepperoni, while other ones do not. Chef wants to cut the pizza vertically in half and give the two halves to two of his friends. Formally, one friend should get everything in columns 1 through N/2N/2N/2 and the other friend should get everything in the columns N/2+1N/2+1N/2+1 through N. Before cutting the pizza, Chef may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): choose an integer x (1≤x≤N1≤x≤N1 le x le N) and reverse the x-th row of the grid ― in other words, for each valid i, the cell in the i-th column and x-th row is moved to the N+1−iN+1−iN+1-i-th column in the same row. After the pizza is cut, let's denote the number of cells containing pepperoni in the first half and in the second half by p1p1p_1 and p2p2p_2 respectively. Chef wants to minimise their absolute difference |p1−p2||p1−p2||p_1-p_2|, but he is lazy, so he just wants you to perform any valid sequence of operations such that the absolute difference in the final grid is minimized. You need to find a final grid (the grid after performing all operations) such that |p1−p2||p1−p2||p_1 - p_2| for this grid is the smallest possible. If there are multiple final grids that minimise |p1−p2||p1−p2||p_1 - p_2|, you may find any one.

Up for a Game ,"Chef is again playing a game with his best friend Garry. As usual, the rules of this game are extremely strange and uncommon. First, they are given a stack of N discs. Each disc has a distinct, non-negative integer written on it. The players exchange turns to make a move. Before the start of the game, they both agree upon a set of positive integers S of size K. It is guaranteed that S contains the integer 1. In a move, a player can select any value x from S and pop exactly x elements from the top of the stack. The game ends when there are no discs remaining. Chef goes first. Scoring: For every disc a player pops, his score increases by 2p2p2^p where p is the integer written on the disc. For example, if a player pops the discs, with integers p1,p2,p3,…,pmp1,p2,p3,…,pmp_1, p_2, p_3, dots, p_m written on it, during the entire course of the game, then his total score will be 2p1+2p2+2p3+⋯+2pm2p1+2p2+2p3+⋯+2pm2^{p_1} + 2^{p_2} + 2^{p_3} + dots + 2^{p_m}. The player with higher score wins the game. Determine the winner if both the players play optimally, or if the game ends in a draw.

Abdullah and Toll Discounts ,"Abdullah has recently moved to Tolland. In Tolland, there are N cities (numbered 1 through N) connected by N−1N−1N-1 bidirectional roads such that it is possible to visit any city from any other city. For each city i, there is a toll value TLiTLiTL_i. Abdullah lives in city X. He has planned a tour of Tolland lasting for 2N2N2N days. For each i (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N1 le i le N), on the 2i−12i−12i-1-th day, he travels from city X to city i, and on the 2i2i2i-th day, he travels from city i back to city X. In Tolland, there are also special discount coupons. For each city c and positive integer v, there is a discount coupon for city c with value v. All discount coupons may be bought anywhere in Tolland; the cost of each discount coupon is twice its value. When travelling from any city i to any (not necessarily different) city j, Abdullah must pay a toll exactly once in each city on the path between them (including i and j); even if he passed through some cities before, he must pay the toll in these cities as well. For any city i, the toll is TLiTLiTL_i when not using any discount coupons; however, if Abdullah bought some discount coupons for city i, he may use some or all of them to decrease this toll to max(0,TLi−V)max(0,TLi−V)mathrm{max},(0, TL_i-V), where V is the sum of values of coupons for city i used by Abdullah. Each coupon may be used at most once per day, but they do not expire when used and the same coupon may be used on multiple days. On each day, Abdullah may use any coupons he wants, but a coupon for city i may only be used to decrease the toll in city i. Abdullah has a travel budget: on each day, he must not spend more than K units of money on paying tolls. Before the start of the tour, he may choose to buy any number of discount coupons, for any cities and with any values (possibly different ones for different cities); the cost of coupons is not included in the budget for any day of the tour. Help Abdullah find the minimum total amount of money he must spend on discount coupons so that on each day during the tour, he will be able to stay within his budget by using the coupons he bought.

How to Write a Message ,"One day, you decided to write a message to your girl friend consisting of N uppercase English letters. Your girlfriend's alphabet is limited to only two letters: 'A' and 'B'. She recognizes only the words that are of length M containing letters from her alphabet. There are some words that your girlfriend hates. You are given two strings X and Y, which represent some two words she recognizes. Your girlfriend hates words X, Y and also each word that she recognizes and is lexicographically greater than X and smaller than Y . For example, if M = 3, X = ""ABA"" and Y = ""BBA"" then all words the girlfriend hates are: ""ABA"", ""ABB"", ""BAA"", ""BAB"" and ""BBA"". Note that she doesn't hate words ""A"", ""BB"", ""AC"" or ""BCAD"". The message that you will send to the girlfriend should not contain any of words she hates as a substring. Note that the message can contain letters the girl doesn't recognize. The message will contain N uppercase English letters. Find the number of different messages you can send.

Little Elephant and Magic ,"The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv believes in magic. He has a magic board A that consists of N rows and M columns. Each cell of the board contains an integer from 0 to 9 inclusive. The cell at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column is denoted as (i; j), where 1 ≤ i ≤ N and 1 ≤ j ≤ M. The number in the cell (i; j) is denoted as A[i][j]. The Little Elephant owns the only magic operation which can be described as follows. He chooses some integer P and some row or column, after that for each cell in the chosen row or column he adds number P to the number in this cell and take the result modulo 10 in order to keep numbers in the range {0, 1, ., 9}. Our Little Magician wants to perform series of such operations to achieve some board for which certain characteristic called level of the board is maximal possible. So what is the level of the board? Bluntly speaking it is the length of the longest non-increasing subsequence of cells of the board. Formally, the level of the board is the maximal integer K such that there exists such sequence of different cells (i1; j1), (i2; j2), ., (iK; jK) for which 1 ≤ i1 ≤ . ≤ iK ≤ N, 1 ≤ j1 ≤ . ≤ jK ≤ M, and A[i1][j1] ≥ A[i2][j2] ≥ . ≥ A[iK][jK]. Though, the magic operation, the Little Elephant owns, is quite powerful, there are some restrictions dictated by the Association of Cursed Magicians (ACM): The number P should be chosen in advance and should be the same for all operations. For each row the magic operation can be applied at most once. The same, of course, is true for columns. Without these stupid restrictions of this stupid Association our hero could always achieve the maximal possible level M + N − 1. But now he is confused and asks you for help. Find the maximal level of the board A after making arbitrary number of magic operations according to the restrictions of ACM.

Mathison and the teleportation game ,"Mathison and Chef are playing a new teleportation game. This game is played on a R×CR×CR times C board where each cell (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) contains some value Vi,jVi,jV_{i, j}. The purpose of this game is to collect a number of values by teleporting from one cell to another. A teleportation can be performed using a tel-pair. A player is given N tel-pairs. Each tel-pair can be used at most once and a player can use them in any order they like. Suppose a player is at cell (a,b)(a,b)(a, b) and the tel-pair is (dx,dy)(dx,dy)(dx, dy). Then, the player can reach in one teleportation any cell (c,d)(c,d)(c, d) from (a,b)(a,b)(a, b) such that |a−c|=dx|a−c|=dx|a − c| = dx and |b−d|=dy|b−d|=dy|b − d| = dy. It is Mathison’s turn next in the game to make a sequence of moves. He would like to know what is the highest value of a path of length at most N+1N+1N+1 that starts in (Sx,Sy)(Sx,Sy)(Sx, Sy) and uses some (possibly none) of the tel-pairs given. The length of a path is equal to the number of cells in the path. The value of a path is equal to the sum of Vi,jVi,jV_{i, j} over all cells in the path.

Traveling Plan ,"According to many researches, people can stand on a bus for several hours, but waiting for a bus for more than 30 minutes at a bus station can make us exhausted. The Chef is a perfect example for this fact. He always tries to reduce the longest period of time of waiting for a bus. Therefore, optimizing the traveling plan for him is far from an easy task. Let's consider the bus system with N bus stations (numbered from 1 to N) and M buses (numbered from 1 to M). Each bus is represented by 4 integer numbers U, V, S, E which means it will start at the bus station U at the time S and arrive at the bus station V at the time E with no intermediate bus stations. If passenger arrives at the bus station U at the time X ≤ S, he has to wait for S − X units of time to catch this bus. Note, that if he arrives at the bus station U exactly at time S he can catch this bus with no waiting time. The Chef starts at the time 0 in the bus station 1, and he wants to arrive at the bus station N in a way that the longest period that he spends for waiting for a bus is as small as possible. Besides, he must be at the bus station N before or at the time T for a specially important meeting. Note, that he may wait for a meeting if he arrives at the bus station N early but that period is not our concern here, since he doesn't wait for any bus at that time.

Vaibhav and Ministers ,"Shortly after joining the Parliament, our Chef has been elected as the new Prime Minister. Now, being the PM, he can do one good or bad deed per day. Initially, Chef has a reputation with his cabinet equal to 0; when he does a good deed, his reputation increases by 1 and when he does a bad deed, his reputation decreases by 1. Chef plans to do exactly p good deeds and exactly q bad deeds. However, to do a bad deed, his reputation must be strictly greater than c (before doing this deed) — otherwise, he would lose the confidence of his cabinet and be forced to resign. DGP Vaibhav has been dealing with corrupt ministers for a long time. In the past, he has arrested M corrupt ministers. For each 1≤i≤M1≤i≤M1 le i le M, when the i-th minister was arrested, that minister had done gigig_i good deeds and bibib_i bad deeds. Over time, Vaibhav has become an expert at detecting and arresting corrupt ministers — Chef is certain that immediately after he performs exactly gigig_i good deeds and exactly bibib_i bad deeds (for some i between 1 and M inclusive), he will end up arrested by Vaibhav. Since Chef plans to be a good PM, we may assume he won't be arrested by Vaibhav for any other reason.

Hopscotch ,"""We’ve already come too far to end this now"". N players advance to the fifth round and the game is going to be Hopscotch. Every player has to select one mannequin before the start of the game. Players are numbered 1 to N.

If Ai=jAi=jA_i = j where j≠ij≠ij neq i, the ithithi^{text{th}} player decides the mannequin for the jthjthj^{text{th}} player. If Ai=0Ai=0A_i = 0, the ithithi^{text{th}} player hasn’t decided yet. The VIPs want to know the number of ways that the undecided players can select mannequins such that everyone gets a mannequin, and no undecided players select their own mannequin.

Binary Land ,"Chefland is a city that always changes. It can be viewed as a grid with a fixed width N (with N columns numbered 1 through N) and changing height. The rows of the grid are numbered with positive integers. Each cell in Chefland has a colour, which is either '0' or '1'. From a cell (x,y)(x,y)(x, y), it is possible to move to one of the cells (x+1,y−1)(x+1,y−1)(x+1, y-1), (x+1,y)(x+1,y)(x+1, y) and (x+1,y+1)(x+1,y+1)(x+1, y+1), but only if the destination cell exists and has the same colour as the origin cell. In Chefland, rows sometimes appear or disappear. However, a row may only appear at the bottom of the grid or disappear if it was at the top of the grid; whenever that happens, rows are renumbered with positive integers from top to bottom in such a way that the topmost row has number 1. Now, Chef received a difficult task ― keeping track of the number of ways to move from the topmost row to the bottommost row. He is asking you to help him answer Q queries. Initially, the grid is empty ― it has 0 rows. There are three types of queries: add L: You are given a string L with length N. A new row appears; for each valid i, the colour of the cell in this row and the i-th column is LiLiL_i. remove: The topmost row disappears. path c d: Find the number of paths starting in the cell in the topmost row and c-th column and ending in the cell in the bottommost row and d-th column. Two paths are considered different if there is a cell which is visited in one path, but not in the other. Since this number can be very big, compute it modulo 1,0,0,0071,0,0,0071,0,0,007.

Battle Royale ,"Chef invented a new game named Quick Battle Royale. N people play the game. One or more rounds are played until all players except one are eliminated. In each round: Let there be x non-eliminated players at the start of the round. Let's number them 1 through x. First, each of these players chooses an integer between 1 and x inclusive. For each valid i, let's denote the integer chosen by the i-th player by pipip_i. In addition, each player is not allowed to choose pi=ipi=ip_i = i. Under these conditions, all players choose uniformly randomly and independently. Then, the elimination process starts. For each i from 1 to x, in this order: if the player i is currently still in the game, the player pipip_i is eliminated from the game immediately if the player i was already eliminated from the game in this round, nothing happens Note that it is impossible for all players to be eliminated and in each round, at least one player is eliminated. For example, a game for N=4N=4N = 4 could look like this: Round 1: The players choose p1=3p1=3p_1 = 3, p2=4p2=4p_2 = 4, p3=2p3=2p_3 = 2, p4=2p4=2p_4 = 2. For i=1i=1i = 1, since player 1 is still in the game, player pi=3pi=3p_i = 3 is eliminated. For i=2i=2i = 2, since player 2 is also in the game, player pi=4pi=4p_i = 4 is eliminated. Since the players 3 and 4 are eliminated, nothing more happens. Round 2: Two players remain. The only choice they have is p1=2p1=2p_1 = 2 and p2=1p2=1p_2 = 1. For i=1i=1i = 1, since player 1 is still in the game, player pi=2pi=2p_i = 2 gets eliminated. For i=2i=2i = 2, player 2 is eliminated, so nothing happens. Now there is one player left, so the game ends. It lasted 2 rounds. You have to find the expected value of the number of rounds the game will last. It can be shown that the expected number of rounds can be written as a fraction pqpqfrac{p}{q}, where p and q are positive integers and q is coprime with 109+7109+710^9+7. You have to compute p⋅q−1p⋅q−1p cdot q^{-1} modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7, where q−1q−1q^{-1} is the multiplicative inverse of q modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7.

Since solving this problem proved to be too easy, Chef is now wondering: in how many ways could he pick a set of M distinct intervals such that all of their endpoints belong to the set {1,2,…,N}{1,2,…,N}{1, 2, ldots, N} and the number of intervals in the solution to the Activity Selection Problem for this set is exactly K?

K-Tuple Tree ,"Chef opened a chain of restaurants in Chefland and invited his K friends (numbered 1 through K) to move there. Chefland can be represented by a tree with N vertices (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the i-th vertex has a type cicic_i. There are K+1K+1K+1 types of vertices: ci=0ci=0c_i = 0 means that there is a restaurant in vertex i, while 1≤ci≤K1≤ci≤K1 le c_i le K means that there is a house with a colour cicic_i in vertex i. For each valid i, the i-th friend of Chef agrees to move to Chefland only if he will live in a house of colour i. Friends want to meet frequently, so Chef needs to choose houses for his friends in such a way that for each pair of friends, there is at least one restaurant on the unique simple path between their houses. Find the number of ways to choose houses for all friends. Formally, you have to find the number of sequences of vertices (v1,v2,…,vK)(v1,v2,…,vK)(v_1, v_2, ldots, v_K) such that: for each i (1≤i≤K1≤i≤K1 le i le K), cvi=icvi=ic_{v_i} = i for each i and j (1≤i<j≤K1≤i<j≤K1 le i lt j le K), there is at least one vertex with type 0 on the path between viviv_i and vjvjv_j Since the number of these sequences could be large, compute it modulo 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353.

Devu and Locks ,"Devu likes to play with a lock of N dials. Each dial rotates from numbers 0 to 9 clockwise (i.e. 0 to 1, 2 to 3 and 8 to 9). You can not rotate from 9 to 0. Initially all the dials of the lock are set to 0. From the current lock, Devu can move any dial to at most 10 different positions (i.e. 0 to 9), so there are total 10N different locks possible. Let us say for a lock we define cost of converting the initial lock (all zeros) to this lock. For this, we have to rotate each dial to corresponding position in the lock. Cost of moving a single dial to value x takes x seconds. eg. cost of moving to 123 is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 and cost of moving to 99 is 9 + 9 is 18. Now Devu has to hurry up to meet his girlfriend, So he has at most M seconds to spend, he wonders how many possible locks he can create such that when a lock is represented as a decimal number, it should be divisible by P.

Snakes capturing the Mongoose Cities ,"The Mongoose Land consists of N cities and they are connected by N - 1 bidirectional roads in such a manner that you can travel from one city to another city in exactly one path. In other words, the map looks like a tree. The cities are numbered from 1 to N. King Cobra has decided that he wants to eliminate the mongooses, and is hence preparing to wage a war. The snakes have recently procured airplanes, and thus they can parachute their soldiers onto some of the Mongoose Land cities. Suppose on Day 0, these soldiers are parachuted. You know that to capture City i, you need to parachute in Pi soldiers. By end of Day 0, they would have captured their respective cities. Each city depends on its neighbors for some of its supplies, and so, if a certain number of its neighbors are captured, then this city will fall as well. In particular, for every City i, you know that if City i was uncaptured on Day d, and at least Ci of its neighbors are captured on Day d, then this city will be captured on Day d+1, where d ≥ 0. A city which has been captured will forever remain captured. King Cobra doesn't mind waiting for however long it takes to capture the entire Mongoose kingdom, but he wants to do it with the least number of soldiers. Help him find the least number of soldiers he should send so that the entire Mongoose kingdom can be captured eventually. Formally, you need to find a subset of cities, S, such that the sum of Pi over these cities is minimized, and the entire kingdom will be captured eventually, if soldiers are parachuted into exactly these cities. You need to output this minimum sum. Tags: DP on Trees, DFS Advanced Algorithms, Advanced DP, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/CAPTCITI,CC

"After the War, Aid ","Cooper is dangling above Mann’s planet in his lander. Dr Mann has in vain tried to dock with the Endurance, resulting in a huge blast. Cooper is trying to save the Endurance by docking with it, but Dr Mann stops him. So Cooper has to attack Dr Mann’s lander to stop him from getting to the Endurance and save the planet. Cooper has n missiles arranged in a line each labeled with an impact number (positive, negative, or zero). You can throw as many missiles at Dr Mann as you like, and if a missile hits his spacecraft, it will cause damage to him. Each missile will hit it’s target exactly once. He can launch either one or two consecutive missiles at a time. He can launch only consecutive missiles together. If he launches two missiles, he causes damage equal to the product of the impact numbers on the missiles. Otherwise, if only one missile is launched, he causes damage equal to the impact number on the missile. For example, if the line of missiles is (5;−3;−5;1;2;9;−4)(5;−3;−5;1;2;9;−4)(5; −3; −5; 1; 2; 9; −4), the maximum possible damage is 353535, by launching missile pairs (−3;−5)(−3;−5)(−3; −5) and (2;9)(2;9)(2; 9), and each other missile separately. Note that a higher damage of 393939 is possible if the missile (−4)(−4)(-4) is not launched, but Cooper has to launch all the missiles to make sure that he also decreases the weight of his lander. Given the line of missile numbers, Cooper wants you to find the maximum possible damage and the set of pairs of missiles required to achieve this score and also the number of missiles.

They can't move out of the grid or stay in the same cell. Alice starts with an initial score of 0. The game proceeds as follows: Alice moves to a neighboring cell of her choice (horizontally, vertically or diagonally). Her score increases by the integer on the cell she just moved to. If Alice and Bob are in the same cell, then the game ends, else Bob moves to a neighboring cell of his choice. If Alice and Bob are in the same cell, then the game ends, else go to step 1.

The government is ready to allocate x tugriks for the implementation of the project to give out dakimakuras. They also agreed with local producers, so the dakimakuras themselves are free.

For each city with an open branch for issuing dakimakuras, the government can pay 1 tugrik to increase its productivity by 1 unit. It can be increased any number of times, so that a productivity of k units costs k tugriks. Then the issuance of dakimakuras begins. For each resident of the country that is located in city i, he/she will travel to the first city with index greater or equal to i that has a branch. Recall, it takes TiTiT_i hours to travel from city i to i+1i+1i+1. After arrival, he/she enters the queue in the branch. For each branch, it handles the queue as follows. Let the productivity of this branch be p. If there are less than p people in the queue, then the branch issues dakimakuras to everyone in the queue. Otherwise, it starts with the first p people, and gives them dakimakuras. A branch can only give dakimakuras every hour (that is, integer times since the start). Also, a resident cannot receive a dakimakura at the same moment he/she enters the queue. You must find the minimum amount of time required for the government to issue dakimakuras to all residents of Berland, spending no more than x tugriks in total.

Chef and Gordon Ramsay 2 ,"In the original Chef and Gordon Ramsay problem, Chef wanted to close all but three of this restaurants, and used his arch-rival Gordon's Secret Restaurant Placement Formula to decide which three to leave open to ensure their success. Chef is now seeking to expand his chain of restaurants to a new town and, would you know it, the dastardly Gordon has already set up his own chain of restaurants there! Once again, Chef conducts a little Industrial Espionage Market Research and discovers that Gordon's Secret Restaurant Placement Formula is different for this new town: the optimal way to arrange restaurants is still in triples, but this time, the restaurants in any optimal triple have to be equidistant from each other. Just like before, Chef is wondering about the number of ways to build an optimally successful triple of restaurants in this new town. More formally, the new town has N sites (numbered 1 through N) connected by N−1N−1N - 1 bidirectional roads (the length of each road is 1 mile) in such a way that any site v can be reached from any other site u using these roads. For any pair of sites u and v, let dist(u,v)dist(u,v)textit{dist}(u, v) be the length, in miles, of the shortest sequence of roads that connects u and v. Some sites have been deemed suitable for building a restaurant; other sites are unsuitable. Help Chef find the number of ways to choose an ordered triple of sites (p,q,r)(p,q,r)(p, q, r) on which he could build his restaurants such that this arrangement of restaurants would be optimally successful, i.e.: p, q and r are pairwise distinct. p, q and r are all suitable sites. p, q and r are equidistant from one another, i.e. dist(p,q)=dist(q,r)=dist(r,p)dist(p,q)=dist(q,r)=dist(r,p)textit{dist}(p,q) = textit{dist}(q,r) = textit{dist}(r,p).

Lousy Game ,"A boy is playing a game on his old computer. The game involves a rectangular piece of land which is divided into m x n cells and an adventurer who is trying to get from one corner of the land to the other. The area is full of bottomless pits that will kill the adventurer if he falls into them. The boy would normally be able to control the adventurer by making him move from one cell to any other cell that is immediately north, south, east or west of the adventurur's current location. Sadly the old computer's keyboard is missing some keys. The boy is now only able to go north or east. Assuming the adventurer starts from the cell at the south-western end and must reach the north-eastern end you must decide whether the boy can guide the adventurer safely through the land to his destination (without falling into any of the pits) while only moving one cell north or east at a time. INPUT The first line will contain T, the number of test cases. The second line contains the dimensions m and n, both integers. m lines follow each with n numbers. Here, 1 indicates a safe cell while a 0 indicates a pit. OUTPUT The output must be simply YES or NO. Where YES will indicate existence of the route and NO means no such route available.

Chef and Sad Pairs ,"Chef has recently set up a network between the N residents of the dormitory. Each resident owns a personal computer. There are direct connections between E pairs of computers. Pairs of computers not directly connected can still communicate if there is a path between them in the network. All N residents are fans of Basketball, but each one has their own favorite team. The ith resident's favorite team is team Gi. Naturally, fans of the same team want to communicate with each other via the network. Unfortunately, Chef isn't too knowledgeable about computers so he didn't ensure that all pairs of computers can communicate with each other. We call a pair of residents (i, j) sad if they have the same favorite team (i.e., Gi = Gj) but they can't communicate with each other. Thus, there can be many sad pairs in the network right now. Even worse, from time to time, someone gets disconnected from the network, further increasing the number of sad pairs. When a resident is disconnected, all direct connections to and from his/her computer becomes unusable. Chef didn't anticipate all these problems and has turned to you for help. Your first task is to submit a report containing N integers, where the ith integer is the number of sad pairs in the network if the ith resident was disconnected.

Playing World War II ,"Enigma: The military machine used by Nazi Germany to encipher messages before and during World War II. The code of Enigma was broken once by Polish Cipher Bureau in 1932 and then again, during the war, by the Codebreaker team at Bletchley Park, England. Because of this, the Allied Powers were able to intercept a lot of messages transferred by German military and knew their battle plans. It is said that, breaking of Enigma shortened the length of that war by two years. But, in the time of war, Allies were gravely concerned about the possibility of Germans finding out this security breach and resetting their communication system. They were very disciplined about using the information in order to hide this source of intelligence. Their precautions included leading fake invasions, superfluous search missions and attacking only after creating a proper cover story. Even at times, they considered sabotaging own resources during a battle which resulted in the death toll of hundreds of soldiers, civilians and massive loss on supplies; just to avoid any suspicion! It seems like they played with probabilities leaving peoples’ lives hanging on the decision. Cruel, wasn’t it? Can you do it? There are N battles ahead. The probability that Allies will win the ith battle is Pi. The enemies are calculating a value PEB (Probability that Enigma has been broken). If the allies win a battle, the value of PEB increases; if the enemy wins the battle, the value decreases. If the value of PEB gets too high, the enemy will become suspicious and replace Enigma with something else. PEB is calculated as an average from results of all previous battles using the following method. total := 0 foreach Battle, bi if Allies win total += probability of Allies losing in bi else total -= probability of Allies winning in bi PEB = max(total / no. of battles, 0) As the Allies already deciphered Enigma, they can choose to win or lose any battle they want. Consider the following scenario as example: Some battles are more important than others; the ith battle has an Impact Factor Fi. As a war analyst, your job is to maximize the sum of Impact Factors of all the battles won. But the enemies must not know that Allies have deciphered Enigma, so you must keep PEB less than a certain threshold, S; throughout the whole war.

Hiring Chefs ,"Chef Shahhoud wants to hire new chefs for his restaurant. Shahhoud posted a job offer on Chef Rami's paper ""Fast Food Times"". N candidates (numbered 1 through N) have applied for the job. There are M traits that define how good a chef is. You are given N strings S1,S2,…,SNS1,S2,…,SNS_1, S_2, ldots, S_N describing the traits of the candidates. Each of these strings has length M. For each valid i and j, the j-th character of SiSiS_i is '1' if the i-th chef has the j-th trait or '0' if this chef does not have this trait. Shahhoud wants to choose a non-empty subsequence H (not necessarily contiguous) of the sequence (1,2,…,N)(1,2,…,N)(1, 2, ldots, N) and hire all candidates from H. However, the sequence H must satisfy an additional condition: for any two consecutive elements of H (let's denote them by x and y), candidates x and y have no common traits, to prevent fights between them.

The description of the game goes as follows : Consider an array A of N non-negative integers. You can do the following move any number of times, pick two numbers from the array (x, y), such that x ≥ y and convert them into (x - y, 2 * y). The aim of the game is to make the array contains exactly (N - 1) zeros. If Dobby achieves this, after any number of steps, he wins the game. Bhuvan wants to know the odds to choose an initial array satisfying for every index i, the condition 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ B[i] where B is given in input and Dobby wins the game with such an array. So please help him counting the number of such arrays, since the answer can be very large, output the answer modulo 109 + 7.

Party Planning ,"Bilbo is planning his eleventy first birthday. Yes, he will soon be 1 years old. He has to decide whom all to invite to the Party. There are N families in the Shire (numbered 1 to N), and some families hate others. For example, the Bagginses of Bag End are on bad terms with the Sackville Bagginses. Each family declares which among the N families do they hate the most (we call this simply the ""enemy"" of the family). Given the N enemies of each of the N families, Bilbo is interested in how many ways can he invite people to his party, such that he does not simultaneously invite some family as well as its enemy. Since the number may be large, output the answer modulo 1007. Two ways are considered different if the set of families invited differ.

Elevator ,"Chef's apartment consists of M floors (numbered 1 through M), and there's an elevator that is used to move between different floors. The elevator is connected with a computer which registers its movement in a sequence B. Whenever the elevator moves to a different floor, the computer appends the new floor number to sequence B. Currently, the sequence B has N elements. Unfortunately, the computer is infected with a virus which replaced some elements of B by −1−1-1s. Chef now wants to know what could be the minimum number of times the elevator has changed its direction. That is, how many times the elevator was going up then started going down and vice versa.

Weasel finds Staircase ,"Weasel loves histograms. Weasel feels that he is very much out of shape and asks for Chef’s advice. Chef convinced Weasel that the only way to get back in shape is to work out. Weasel decides to follow Chef’s advice and has formulated the greatest workout plan - to reflect his love for histograms - in which he will go down the staircase every day. However, Weasel is not in the best shape, so, for starters, he can only go down at most K steps. Formally, a staircase is a set of adjacent rectangles with at most K changes of height. These rectangles should have either increasing or decreasing heights. The rectangles should start from the bottom (see images in the explanation section for clarification), and the height of rectangle at i-th position shouldn't be more than histogrami. For each of the T cases, you have to find the greatest area of a staircase that matches the above-mentioned restrictions.

Deja Vu ,"You're given a sequence of N - distinct positive integers, not necessarily sorted in ascending order. Your task is pretty straightforward: sort the sequence in ascending order. At any point of time, you can perform one of the following operations: If there is only one sequence, with a length greater than 1, split it at some point to divide it into two non-empty sequences. The cost to perform this operation is the minimum of the sizes of the two broken parts. If there are multiple sequences (due to one or more split operations in the past), you may choose one of them with a length greater than 1 and split it at some point to divide it into two non-empty sequences. The cost to perform this operation is the minimum of the sizes of the two broken parts. If there are multiple sequences (due to one or more split operations in the past), you may choose two of them and concatenate them in any order. The cost to perform this operation is the length of the resulting sequence, i.e., the sum of the lengths of the first and the second part. It turns out that there are a LOT of ways to sort the array by following this scheme! You need to find out the minimum cost of all the operations required to sort the array in the optimal manner.

Bear and Bribing Tree ,"Limak is a big grizzly bear who loves wrestling. He is going to participate in a coming tournament. There will be N = 2H bears participating in the tournament. Bears are numbered 1 through N and Limak has index 1. Each bear has a unique value xi representing his or her strength. The tournament is divided into H stages. In each stage bears are divided into pairs according to their indices (more info in the next paragraph). In each pair, the two bears fight with each other and one of them wins (there are no draws). The loser is eliminated, while the winner advances to the next stage. In each stage, the remaining bears are sorted by their initial index. Then, the first two bears are in one pair, next two are in the second pair, and so on. So in the first stage there are N/2 matches: one between bear 1 and bear 2, one between bear 3 and bear 4, and so on (the last match between bear N-1 and bear N). In the second stage, the winner of the fight between bear 1 and bear 2, will fight against the winner of the fight between bear 3 and bear 4, and so on. Usually, when two bears fight with each other, the one with greater strength wins. But grizzly bears aren't always honest and fair. In each match (no matter if he fights in it or not), Limak can bribe the referee and change the winner of this match. To avoid suspicion, he can do it only if the difference between strengths of the two bears doesn't exceed K. For example, let's say that K = 10. If two bears with strength 70 and 85 fight with each other, the one with strength 85 must win. But if their strengths are 70 and 78 (or e.g. 70 and 80), Limak can bribe the referee and then the bear with strength 70 wins — but obviously Limak doesn't have to bribe the referee and then the bear with greater strength automatically wins. What is the minimum number of times Limak has to bribe a referee, if he wants to win the tournament? Output -1 if he can't win.

Factorial ,"The most important part of a GSM network is so called Base Transceiver Station (BTS). These transceivers form the areas called cells (this term gave the name to the cellular phone) and every phone connects to the BTS with the strongest signal (in a little simplified view). Of course, BTSes need some attention and technicians need to check their function periodically. The technicians faced a very interesting problem recently. Given a set of BTSes to visit, they needed to find the shortest path to visit all of the given points and return back to the central company building. Programmers have spent several months studying this problem but with no results. They were unable to find the solution fast enough. After a long time, one of the programmers found this problem in a conference article. Unfortunately, he found that the problem is so called ""Traveling Salesman Problem"" and it is very hard to solve. If we have N BTSes to be visited, we can visit them in any order, giving us N!N!N! possibilities to examine. The function expressing that number is called factorial and can be computed as a product: 1.2.3.4..N1.2.3.4..N1.2.3.4..N. The number is very high even for a relatively small N. The programmers understood they had no chance to solve the problem. But because they have already received the research grant from the government, they needed to continue with their studies and produce at least some results. So they started to study behaviour of the factorial function. For example, they defined the function Z. For any positive integer N, Z(N) is the number of zeros at the end of the decimal form of number N!N!N!. They noticed that this function never decreases. If we have two numbers N1<N2N1<N2N_1 < N_2 then Z(N1)≤Z(N2)Z(N1)≤Z(N2)Z(N_1) le Z(N_2). It is because we can never ""lose"" any trailing zero by multiplying by any positive number. We can only get new and new zeros. The function Z is very interesting, so we need a computer program that can determine its value efficiently.

Greedy puppy ,"Tuzik is a little dog. But despite the fact he is still a puppy he already knows about the pretty things that coins are. He knows that for every coin he can get very tasty bone from his master. He believes that some day he will find a treasure and have loads of bones. And finally he found something interesting. A wooden chest containing N coins! But as you should remember, Tuzik is just a little dog, and so he can't open it by himself. Actually, the only thing he can really do is barking. He can use his barking to attract nearby people and seek their help. He can set the loudness of his barking very precisely, and therefore you can assume that he can choose to call any number of people, from a minimum of 1, to a maximum of K. When people come and open the chest they divide all the coins between them in such a way that everyone will get the same amount of coins and this amount is maximal possible. If some coins are not used they will leave it on the ground and Tuzik will take them after they go away. Since Tuzik is clearly not a fool, he understands that his profit depends on the number of people he will call. While Tuzik works on his barking, you have to find the maximum possible number of coins he can get.

Carvans ,"Most problems on CodeChef highlight chef's love for food and cooking but little is known about his love for racing sports. He is an avid Formula 1 fan. He went to watch this year's Indian Grand Prix at New Delhi. He noticed that one segment of the circuit was a long straight road. It was impossible for a car to overtake other cars on this segment. Therefore, a car had to lower down its speed if there was a slower car in front of it. While watching the race, Chef started to wonder how many cars were moving at their maximum speed. Formally, you're given the maximum speed of N cars in the order they entered the long straight segment of the circuit. Each car prefers to move at its maximum speed. If that's not possible because of the front car being slow, it might have to lower its speed. It still moves at the fastest possible speed while avoiding any collisions. For the purpose of this problem, you can assume that the straight segment is infinitely long. Count the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the straight segment.

A Problem on Sticks ,"On a sunny day, Akbar and Birbal were taking a leisurely walk in palace gardens. Suddenly, Akbar noticed a bunch of sticks on the ground and decided to test Birbal's wits. There are N stick holders with negligible size (numbered 1 through N) in a row on the ground. Akbar places all the sticks in them vertically; for each valid i, the initial height of the stick in the i-th holder is AiAiA_i. Birbal has a stick cutter and his task is to completely cut all these sticks, i.e. reduce the heights of all sticks to 0. He may perform zero or more operations; in each operation, he should do the following: Choose an integer H and fix the cutter at the height H above the ground. The cutter moves from the 1-st to the N-th stick holder. Whenever it encounters a stick whose current height is greater than H, it cuts this stick down to height H (i.e. for a stick with height h>Hh>Hh gt H, it removes its upper part with length h−Hh−Hh-H). All the upper parts of sticks that are cut in one operation must have equal lengths. Otherwise, the operation may not be performed. For example, if the heights of sticks are initially [5,3,5][5,3,5][5, 3, 5], then some valid values for H in the first operation are 3 and 4 ― the cutter cuts the upper parts of two sticks and their lengths are [2,2][2,2][2, 2] and [1,1][1,1][1, 1] respectively. H=2H=2H = 2 is an invalid choice because it would cut the upper parts of all three sticks with lengths [3,1,3][3,1,3][3, 1, 3], which are not all equal. Akbar wants Birbal to completely cut all sticks in the minimum possible number of operations. If you want to be friends with Birbal, help him solve the problem.

By centre, we mean that there should be an equal number of parts to the left of this part, and to the right of this part. Hi1 = 1 The heights keep increasing by exactly 1, as you move from the leftmost part, to the centre part.

Now he wants to load some elements of this array into the cache. The machine loads the array in blocks with size B: A0,A1,…,AB−1A0,A1,…,AB−1A_0, A_1, ldots, A_{B-1} form a block, AB,AB+1,…,A2B−1AB,AB+1,…,A2B−1A_B, A_{B+1}, ldots, A_{2B-1} form another block, and so on. The last block may contain less than B elements of Chef's array. The cache may only contain at most one block at a time. Whenever Chef tries to access an element AiAiA_i, the machine checks if the block where AiAiA_i is located is already in the cache, and if it is not, loads this block into the cache layer, so that it can quickly access any data in it. However, as soon as Chef tries to access any element that is outside the block currently loaded in the cache, the block that was previously loaded into the cache is removed from the cache, since the machine loads a new block containing the element that is being accessed. Chef has a sequence of elements Ax1,Ax2,…,AxMAx1,Ax2,…,AxMA_{x_1}, A_{x_2}, ldots, A_{x_M} which he wants to access, in this order. Initially, the cache is empty.

Interaction First, you should read a line containing a single integer T ― the number of test cases. The description of interaction for T test cases follows. For each test case, you should start by asking queries. To ask a query, you should print a line containing an integer between 1 and 10610610^6 inclusive ― your guess. Then, you should read a line containing a single integer: 1 if you correctly guessed Chef's secret number, 0 if your guess was incorrect or −1−1-1 if your guess is invalid (in particular, smaller than 1 or greater than 10610610^6) or you have asked more than 2,02,02,0 queries. As soon as you have correctly guessed Chef's secret number, you should stop asking queries and continue solving the remaining test cases. If you read −1−1-1, you must immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Chef and Water Car ,"Chef is a great mechanic. As the cost of petrol is increasing day by day he decided to build a water car to take his girlfriend Natasha on a date. Water car has great build quality but is able to travel only 1 Km on every 1 liter of water. To show off his water car to Natasha he took her to the formula racing track which is an (N−1N−1N-1) km long road with checkpoints numbered 1 to N from left to right. The distance between two adjacent checkpoints is 1 Km. Initially, Chef is at checkpoint number 1 and the tank of the water car is empty. At every checkpoint, there is a water station, but the cost of filling 1 liter of water at a checkpoint is equal to the checkpoint number. Chef can not store more than V liters of water in the tank of a car. Chef is interested in both minimum as well as the maximum cost of filling that can happen to reach the checkpoint number N. You shouldn't have any water left after reaching NthNthN^{th} checkpoint. Also, you are not allowed to pour out water.

Root of the Problem ,"Chef has a binary tree. The binary tree consists of 1 or more nodes. Each node has a unique integer id. Each node has up to 2 children, which are identified by their ids, and each node is the child of at most 1 other node. A node X is considered to be an ancestor of node Y if node Y is a child of node X or if there is some node Z for which X is an ancestor of Z and Y is a child of Z. No node is an ancestor of itself. A special node called the root node is an ancestor of all other nodes. Chef has forgotten which node of his tree is the root, and wants you to help him to figure it out. Unfortunately, Chef's knowledge of the tree is incomplete. He does not remember the ids of the children of each node, but only remembers the sum of the ids of the children of each node.

Chef’s firm has the first M months of the year 2018 to finish this task. (The months in a year are numbered 1 through 12.) Chef's firm has K workers (including Junior Chef) available to work on this case. Each worker can prepare exactly one patent per month. Junior Chef assigns work to workers starting from the first month of the year. He can have any workers work on this case on any month provided that they're chosen according to the following conditions: Each worker can only work on this patent case for at most one month. Each worker has to work either on an even month or an odd month of the year. You are given a string S with length K and the following meaning: for each valid i, if the i-th character of S is E, worker i has to work on an even month; if it's O, this worker has to work on an odd month.

The next a5 elements equal to 5. The next a6 elements equal to 6. The next a7 elements equal to 7. The next a6 elements equal to 6. The next a5 elements equal to 5. The next a4 elements equal to 4. The next a3 elements equal to 3. The next a2 elements equal to 2. The next a1 elements equal to 1. ai is a positive integer, the variables with the same index (a1 in the first statement and a1 in the last one, for example) are equal. There are no any other elements in array. For example, {1,1,2,2,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,7,7,6,5,5,4,3,2,2,2,1,1} is a Rainbow Array. The array {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,6,6,5,4,3,2,1} is not a Rainbow Array, because the sizes of the blocks with the element 6 are different. Please help Chef to count the number of different Rainbow Arrays that contain exactly N elements. Tags: Arithmetic Mathematics, Basic Maths ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/RAINBOWB,CC
Maximize Product ,"You are given two integers N and K. Consider all ways to represent N as the sum of exactly K distinct positive integers x1,x2,…,xKx1,x2,…,xKx_1, x_2, dots, x_K — in other words, xi>0xi>0x_i gt 0 for each valid i, xi≠xjxi≠xjx_i neq x_j for each valid i≠ji≠ji neq j and x1+x2+…+xK=Nx1+x2+…+xK=Nx_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_K = N should hold. You have to find the maximum possible value of the product (x21−x1)⋅(x22−x2)⋅…⋅(x2K−xK)(x12−x1)⋅(x22−x2)⋅…⋅(xK2−xK)(x_1^2 - x_1) cdot (x_2^2 - x_2) cdot ldots cdot (x_K^2 - x_K). Because this number could be huge, compute it modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7. If N cannot be represented as the sum of any K distinct positive integers, output −1−1-1 instead.

The Promised Land ,"Years after the Ishval Civil War, the Ishvalan refugees have now found a safe place for themselves which is a rectangular piece of land, surrounded by fences. The land can be thought of as a 2d grid which extends N units vertically and M units horizontally. It is divided into N horizontal rows, which are numbered from 1 to N, as you move from top to bottom and into M vertical columns numbered from 1 to M, from left to right. There are X rivers flowing in a horizontal direction, each flowing in a different row and covering the entire row. Similarly, there are Y rivers flowing in a vertical direction, each flowing in a different column and covering the entire column.

Minimum Distance ,"In Wolf town there are 2 big markets S and T. The distance between these markets is D. Chef Ciel would like to run 2 restaurants in Wolf town, where the first restaurant will be supplied by the market S and the second one will be supplied by the market T. The markets run delivery service without charge within some distance, DS and DT respectively. Near these markets there are many rival restaurants. So Ciel decides to build one of her restaurants exactly at the distance DS from the market S, and build the other restaurant exactly at the distance DT from the market T. Chef Ciel would like to build her restaurants as close as possible to each other for convenient communication. Your task is to calculate the minimum distance that could be achieved between her restaurants. Note. Wolf town can be considered as an infinite 2D Cartesian plane. The markets and Ciel's restaurants should be considered as points on a plane. The distance between the two points A and B, whose coordinates are (Ax, Ay) and (Bx, By) respectively, is defined by Dist(A, B) = ((Ax − Bx)2 + (Ay − By)2)1/2.

Chef Designed a Network ,"Chef is a network engineer at CodeChef. Currently, he has to design a network that connects N computers (numbered 1 through N). The network should consist of these N computers and exactly M cables. Usually, a cable needs to connect two different computers, but Chef is okay with connecting computers to themselves too. Therefore, let's describe a cable by the pair of computers (u,v)(u,v)(u, v) it connects, where 1≤u≤v≤N1≤u≤v≤N1 le u le v le N. However, for each valid pair of computers (u,v)(u,v)(u, v), there must be at most one cable that directly connects this pair of computers. Let's define the data consumption factor of a computer as the number of computers which are directly connected to it. In particular, if a computer v is directly connected to itself (by a cable (v,v)(v,v)(v, v)), it is only counted as connected to itself once. The data consumption factor of the whole network is the maximum of data consumption factors of all computers. In the resulting network, each computer needs to be connected (directly or indirectly) to all other computers, so that they could communicate with each other. Determine whether it is possible to design such a network. If it is possible, find the minimum possible data consumption factor of the resulting network.

Equality ,"<meta charset=""utf8"" /> An equation is an equality containing one or more variables. Solving the equation consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. In this situation, variables are also known as unknowns and the values which satisfy the equality are known as solutions. An equation differs from an identity in that an equation is not necessarily true for all possible values of the variable. There are many types of equations, and they are found in all areas of mathematics. For instance, a linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable. In this problem we'll consider quite a special kind of systems of linear equations. To be more specific, you are given a system of N linear equations of the following form: x2 + x3 + . + xN - 1 + xN = a1 x1 + x3 + . + xN - 1 + xN = a2 . x1 + x2 + . + xN - 2 + xN = aN - 1 x1 + x2 + . + xN - 2 + xN - 1 = aN In other words, i'th equation of the system consists of the sum of all the variable x1, ., xN except xi to the left of the equality sign and the constant ai to the right of the equality sign. One can easily prove, that a system of linear equations as described above always have exactly one solution in case N is greater than one. Your task is to find the solution of the system(such a sequence x1, x2, ., xN, that turns each of the equations into equality). It's guaranteed, that the solution of the system is a sequence consisting only of integers from the range [1, 108]. Tags: Basic Maths Mathematics ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/EQUALITY,CC

Per Capita Income ,"Chefland consists of N provinces (numbered 1 through N) connected by M bidirectional roads (numbered 1 through M). For each valid i, the i-th road connects provinces UiUiU_i and ViViV_i. It is possible to travel from each province to any other province using these roads. For each valid i, the annual income of the i-th province is AiAiA_i and its population is BiBiB_i. The per-capita income of some provinces is lower than that of some other provinces. For this reason, the king of Chefland wants to choose one or more provinces to keep in his kingdom and abandon the rest, in such a way that the per-capita income of the whole resulting kingdom, i.e. the sum of annual incomes of the chosen provinces divided by the sum of their populations, would be maximum possible. However, it should also be possible to travel from each of the chosen provinces to any other chosen province without visiting any of the abandoned provinces. Among all such ways to form the new kingdom, the king would prefer the number of chosen provinces to be as large as possible. Can you help the king choose which provinces should form the new kingdom? If there are multiple solutions that maximise the per-capita income, you should choose one with the maximum number of chosen provinces. If there are still multiple solutions, you may choose any one.

Dazzling Even-Odd Challenge ,"Dazzler has an interesting task for you. You will be given an array A of N positive integers such that: N is always even. Exactly N2N2frac{N}{2} elements in the array are even and N2N2frac{N}{2} elements are odd. In one operation, you should do the following steps: Choose two different indices i and j (1≤i,j≤N)(1≤i,j≤N)(1 le i,j le N). Set Ai:=Ai+1Ai:=Ai+1A_i := A_i + 1. Set Aj:=Aj−1Aj:=Aj−1A_j := A_j - 1. You need to apply some finite (possibly zero) number of operations on the array such that: The parity of the final element at each index is same as the parity of the initial element at that index. For example, if the ithithi^{th} element in the initial array is even, then, the ithithi^{th} element in the final array must be even as well. All the N2N2frac{N}{2} odd elements in the final array are equal. All the N2N2frac{N}{2} even elements in the final array are equal.

Highway Crossing ,"Chef has to cross a highway with infinite length consisting of N parallel lanes. The width of each lane is Y. Between each pair of adjacent lanes, there is a divider with negligible width; at each divider and the side of the highway, Chef can wait for an arbitrarily long time to allow the cars to pass by and then continue crossing the highway. Since Chef is lazy, he wants to cross the highway while walking the minimum possible distance; therefore, he will only move in a straight line perpendicular to the highway. Chef walks with a constant velocity S. There is exactly one car in each lane. Each car is as wide as a whole lane (so it covers the entire width of its lane), has a known length and travels with fixed velocity in either direction along the highway. For each i (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N1 le i le N), the car in the i-th lane has velocity ViViV_i and length CiCiC_i. Let's measure distances along the highway, i.e. all points which lie on the same line perpendicular to the highway have the same coordinate x. Chef's position is x=0x=0x=0; for each i (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N1 le i le N), the initial position of the car in the i-th lane is PiPiP_i and the direction in which it's moving is DiDiD_i. If Di=1Di=1D_i = 1, the car is moving in the positive direction (its position is increasing) and if Di=0Di=0D_i = 0, the car is moving in the negative direction (its position is decreasing). The drivers on a highway don't expect anyone to be crossing it, so they drive carelessly and won't be able to apply brakes at any point in time. Find the minimum time Chef needs to cross the highway without getting hit by a car. Chef does not get hit by a car if the minimum distance between him and any car remains greater than 10−610−610^{-6} at all times.

At the end, you guess Shef's prime P and he tells you if your guess was correct. However, Shef will sometimes cheat: he can change his prime any number of times during the game (even after you tell him your guess), but only in such a way that all his answers to your previous questions remain correct. Show Shef that you can always guess the correct prime, even if he tries to cheat! Interaction First, you should read a line containing a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for T test cases follows. For each test case, you should start by asking questions (possibly none). To ask a question, print a line containing two space-separated integers 1 and x. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer. If this integer is −1−1-1, your query was invalid or you asked too many queries, and you should immediately terminate your program to receive the Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Otherwise, this integer denotes Shef's answer to your query. When you think you know Shef's prime P, print a line containing two space-separated integers 2 and P. Then, you must read a line containing a single string ""Yes"" or ""No"". If this string is ""Yes"", you should continue solving the remaining test cases.

Bank robbery ,"Translations in Vietnamese to be uploaded soon. Two cheeky thieves (Chef being one of them, the more talented one of course) have came across each other in the underground vault of the State Bank of Churuland. They are shocked! Indeed, neither expect to meet a colleague in such a place with the same intentions to carry away all the money collected during Churufest 2015. They have carefully counted a total of exactly 1 billion (109) dollars in the bank vault. Now they must decide how to divide the booty. But there is one problem: the thieves have only M minutes to leave the bank before the police arrives. Also, the more time they spend in the vault, the less amount could carry away from the bank. Formally speaking, they can get away with all of the billion dollars right now, but after t minutes they can carry away only 1 billion * pt dollars, where p is some non-negative constant less than or equal to unity, and at t = M, they get arrested and lose all the money. They will not leave the vault until a decision on how to divide the money has been made. The money division process proceeds in the following way: at the beginning of each minute starting from the 1st (that is, t = 0), one of them proposes his own way to divide the booty. If his colleague agrees, they leave the bank with pockets filled with the proposed amounts of dollars. If not, the other one proposes his way at the next minute etc. To escape arrest, they can only propose plans till the beginning of the Mth minute (i.e., till t = M-1). Each thief wants to maximize his earnings, but if there are two plans with the same amounts for him, he would choose the one which leads to a larger total amount of stolen dollars. Chef is about to start this procedure, and he is the first to propose a plan. You are wondering what will be the final division of money, if each thief chooses the optimal way for himself and money is considering real.

Replace A[i+1]A[i+1]A[i+1] with (A[i+1]+1)(A[i+1]+1)(A[i+1]+1). For example, if A=abczeA=abczeA = text{abcze}, a valid move would be to select index 3. This way the string becomes abdaeabdaetext{abdae} after performing the move. Note that the value at an index is cyclically incremented. This means that, a→ba→btext{a} rightarrow text{b}, b→cb→ctext{b} rightarrow text{c}, ……ldots, z→az→atext{z} rightarrow text{a}. Chef has been asked to answer Q queries. Each query is of the form: L R: Given 1≤L≤R≤N1≤L≤R≤N1 leq L leq R leq N, Chef wants to know if it is possible to convert the substring A[L,R]A[L,R]A[L, R] to B[L,R]B[L,R]B[L, R] by performing the above mentioned move any number of times. For each query, output in a single line YesYestext{Yes}, if the conversion is possible using any number of moves. Otherwise, print NoNotext{No}. NOTE: Queries are independent. Thus, the original strings A and B would be retained to process next query. For each query solve for substrings A[L,R]A[L,R]A[L,R] and B[L,R]B[L,R]B[L,R] only. So valid values for i will be among L to R−1R−1R - 1 only. Tags: anript, easy, math, observation, range-queries, start29, strings ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/CCD,CC

Cracking the Code ,".Translations in Vietnamese to be uploaded soon. Wet Shark once had 2 sequences: {a_n}= {a_1, a_2, a_3, . , a_(109)} {b_n} = {b_1, b_2, b_3, . , b_(109)} However, he only kept one element from each sequence. Luckily, both the elements that Wet Shark kept have the same index in Wet Shark's sequences: that is, he took a_i and b_i for some 1 ≤ i ≤ 109. Right after Wet Shark loses his sequences, he finds that he actually needs them to break the code of Cthulhu to escape a labyrinth. Cthulhu's code is a single floating point number Q. However, the code verifier is faulty. If Wet Shark enters any code c such that |c - Q| ≤ 0.01 , Cthulhu's code checker will allow him to escape. Wet Shark now starts to panic, and consults Dry Dolphin for help via ultrasonic waves. After the Dry Dolphin Sequence Processing Factory processes data of Wet Shark's sequences, the machines give Wet Shark the following 2 relations his sequences follow for all 1 ≤ n < 109, where x = sqrt(2) and y = sqrt(3). Wet Shark is now clueless on how to compute anything, and asks you for help. Wet Shark has discovered that Cthulhu's code is actually defined as Q = (a_k + b_k) / (2^s), where s is a predetermined number, k is the index of another element in Wet Shark's sequence, and a_k, b_k are precisely the kth elements of Wet Shark's sequences {a_n} and {b_n}, respectively. Given k, i, and the 2 elements of the arrays Wet Shark has lost, find any value of the code c that will allow Wet Shark to exit Cthulhu's labyrinth.

Bulbs and Wires ,"There are N light bulbs in a row, numbered 1 through N from left to right. Each bulb can be in one of the states ""on"" or ""off"". Initially, all the bulbs are ""off"". Each bulb is also connected to its (at most two) adjacent bulbs by wires. You should reach a state described by a given a binary string S with length N ― for each valid i, if the i-th character of S is '1', the i-th bulb should be ""on"", and if it is '0', the i-th bulb should be ""off"". You may do that by performing the following steps in the given order: Cut up to K of the N−1N−1N-1 wires between adjacent bulbs (possibly none of them). Switch on some bulbs (possibly none). Here, whenever two bulbs are still connected by wires (directly or indirectly) and one of them gets switched on, then the other one also gets switched on. Disconnect some bulbs from the electrical network. Here, disconnecting a bulb switches it off, but it does not affect any other bulbs ― if a bulb was switched on before this step and it was not disconnected in this step, it remains switched on afterwards. Minimise the number of bulbs you need to disconnect in step 3 in order to reach the given final state of the bulbs.

Robot Detector ,"There is a robot in the cell (0,0)(0,0)(0, 0) of an infinite grid. One cell (X,Y)(X,Y)(X, Y) contains an obstacle and all other cells are free. We only know that 1≤X≤R1≤X≤R1 le X le R and 1≤Y≤C1≤Y≤C1 le Y le C, but not the exact location of the obstacle. You may give the robot a sequence of instructions. There are four types of instructions: L: move one cell to the left, i.e. from a cell (x,y)(x,y)(x, y) to (x−1,y)(x−1,y)(x-1, y) R: move one cell to the right, i.e. from a cell (x,y)(x,y)(x, y) to (x+1,y)(x+1,y)(x+1, y) D: move one cell down, i.e. from a cell (x,y)(x,y)(x, y) to (x,y−1)(x,y−1)(x, y-1) U: move one cell up, i.e. from a cell (x,y)(x,y)(x, y) to (x,y+1)(x,y+1)(x, y+1) The robot attempts to perform these instructions one by one. When performing an instruction, if the cell it needs to move to is free, then it moves to that cell; otherwise, it stays in its current cell. Consider the following process: you choose a fixed sequence of instructions for the robot, which performs these instructions; then you are given the final cell of the robot and based on only that information, you determine the position of the obstacle. Find a sufficiently short sequence of instructions such that if this process was performed, you would always be able to correctly determine the position of the obstacle.

You know that for John Jackson, there are N packs containing A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,ANA_1, A_2, ldots, A_N votes, and for Jack Johnson, there are M packs containing B1,B2,…,BMB1,B2,…,BMB_1, B_2, ldots, B_M votes. The winner is the candidate that has strictly more votes than the other candidate; if both have the same number of votes, there is no winner. You are a friend of John Jackson and you want to help him win. To do that, you may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): choose two packs of votes that currently belong to different candidates and swap them, i.e. change the votes in each of these packs so that they would go to the other candidate. You are very careful, so you want to perform as few swaps as possible. Find the smallest number of operations you need to perform or determine that it is impossible to make John Jackson win.

Sell All the Cars ,"Chef owns N cars (numbered 1 through N). He wishes to sell all of them over N years by selling exactly one car per year. For each valid i, the initial price of the i-th car is PiPiP_i. Due to depreciation, the price of each car decreases by 1 unit per year until it is sold. Note that the price of a car cannot drop below 0 no matter how many years have passed, i.e. when the price of a car reaches 0 in some year, it remains 0 in all subsequent years. Find the maximum profit Chef can make if he sells his cars in an optimal way. Since this number may be large, compute it modulo 1,0,0,0071,0,0,0071,0,0,007 (109+7109+710^9+7).

All immediate children of any node have pairwise distinct values. For every node with at least one immediate child, the gcdgcdgcd of the values of all immediate children is equal to the value of the node. The total sum of the values of all nodes should be minimum. The greatest common divisor gcd(a,b)gcd(a,b)gcd(a,b) of two positive integers a and b is equal to the largest integer d such that both integers a and b are divisible by d.

Let us play with rank list ,"A rank list is a list of ranks of persons in a programming contest. Note that some of the persons might be having same rank. {1, 2}, {1, 2, 2} and {1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4} are few examples of rank lists whereas {1, 3}, {0, 2}, {1, 2, 4} are not rank lists. Also note that a rank list need not to be sorted e.g. {2, 2, 1} and {3, 3, 2, 1} are valid rank lists. Mathematically, a rank list is an array of numbers when sorted will have the starting element as 1 and difference between any two consecutive elements less than or equal to 1. A rank list is said to be an ideal rank list if no two persons gets equal rank in it. You can convert any rank list into an ideal rank list by applying following operations. In a single operation, you can change value of any one element of the rank list to any value. Chandan now wonders about minimum number of operations needed to convert a rank list of size n with sum of its element equal to s in to an ideal rank list. Please help Chandan find this minimum number of operations needed to create an ideal rank list. Note that you are guaranteed that values of n, s will be given in such a way that there will exist a valid rank list.

Winning Strategy ,"Problem Statement You are given an array of n integers and there are 2 people: P1P1P1 and P2P2P2. Each person picks up any one element and adds its value to their score. Initially the score of both P1P1P1 and P2P2P2 is 0 . However the person who plays second can take two elements in his/her first try and then both will take one element in alternate turns. Example: if P1P1P1 goes first, then the pickup sequence can look like: P1→P2→P2→P1→P2→P1→P2..P1→P2→P2→P1→P2→P1→P2..P1 → P2 → P2 → P1 → P2 → P1 → P2 .. Each person wants to maximize his/her score and both of them play optimally. P1P1P1 wants to win and is asking for your help. Tell whether P1P1P1 should play ""first"" or ""second"". If both of them will get the same score independent of who plays first, then output “draw”. Note: Each element can be taken only once (i.e. once it is taken by some person, it cannot be taken again).

Code Crazy Minions ,"Coding in Sprout (a programming language) is very intuitive. Chef is giving his minions a demonstration in Sprout and wants you to help him determine if they are not too difficult for them. A program in Sprout is written using three kinds of instructions. Load Instruction: Load a value into buffer. Increment Instruction: Increment the value in buffer. Print Instruction: Print the value from buffer. The buffer stores a single integer between 0 and 25, both inclusive. If the value in the buffer is x, the increment instruction makes the value (x+1), if x < 25. At x = 25 the increment instruction makes the value 0. Load Instruction can be used to load any value between 0 and 25 (inclusive) into the buffer. Print from the buffer prints a lowercase English character based on the value in the buffer. Precisely, it prints the (x+1)th character in the alphabet. Thus, for x = 0, 'a' is printed; x = 1, 'b' is printed and so on. For x = 25, 'z' is printed. To keep his programs clear, he uses the load instruction only once in the beginning (before printing any character). Then he proceeds instruction after instruction. A program is simple, if the number of instructions is not more than ELEVEN times the length of the word that it prints. Given the word Chef wants his program to print and assuming he will write the shortest code (i.e. use the fewest instructions) to print it, will the program be simple?

Many Chefs ,"Chef Ciel wants to put a fancy neon signboard over the entrance of her restaurant. She has not enough money to buy the new one so she bought some old neon signboard through the internet. Ciel was quite disappointed when she received her order - some of its letters were broken. But she realized that this is even better - she could replace each broken letter by any letter she wants. So she decided to do such a replacement that the resulting signboard will contain the word ""CHEF"" as many times as possible. We can model the signboard as a string S having capital letters from 'A' to 'Z', inclusive, and question marks '?'. Letters in the string indicate the intact letters at the signboard, while question marks indicate broken letters. So Ciel will replace each question mark with some capital letter and her goal is to get the string that contains as many substrings equal to ""CHEF"" as possible. If there exist several such strings, she will choose the lexicographically smallest one. Note 1. The string S = S1.SN has the substring ""CHEF"" if for some i we have SiSi+1Si+2Si+3 = ""CHEF"". The number of times ""CHEF"" is the substring of S is the number of those i for which SiSi+1Si+2Si+3 = ""CHEF"". Note 2. The string A = A1.AN is called lexicographically smaller than the string B = B1.BN if there exists K from 1 to N, inclusive, such that Ai = Bi for i = 1, ., K-1, and AK < BK. In particular, A is lexicographically smaller than B if A1 < B1. We compare capital letters by their positions in the English alphabet. So 'A' is the smallest letter, 'B' is the second smallest letter, ., 'Z' is the largest letter. Tags: String, Greedy Data Structures, Algorithms ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/MANYCHEF,CC

These snakes are planning a coup against a mongoose who controls their city from outside. So, they are trying their best to meet with other snakes and spread information about the date of the coup. For spreading this information, they can just hiss from their house and usually their hiss is so loud that it will be heard in all the cells except if there is a soundproof fence built that cuts the voice. Note that the external borders of Snakeland are already built of soundproof material. The mongoose got to know about the plan, and he wants to construct sound proof fences along the borders of the houses so that no two people should be able to communicate with each other. The fence can be either vertical or horizontal. Each fence can be of any length, but the mongoose wants to minimize the number of fences to be built. Find out the minimum number of fences that the mongoose should build. Tags: Greedy, ad-hoc Algorithms, Constructive ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/SNCOUP,CC
Gasoline ,"There are N cars (numbered 1 through N) on a circular track with length N. For each i (2≤i≤N2≤i≤N2 le i le N), the i-th of them is at a distance i−1i−1i-1 clockwise from car 1, i.e. car 1 needs to travel a distance i−1i−1i-1 clockwise to reach car i. For each valid i, you can fill the i-th car's tank with up to fifif_i litres of gasoline, with cost cicic_i coins per litre. After that, you choose some car, sit in this car and start driving in the clockwise direction. To move one unit of distance in this direction, you need to spend 1 litre of gasoline. When you pass another car (even if you'd run out of gasoline exactly at that point), you steal all its gasoline. You cannot move if you do not have any gasoline left. Your goal is to fill the cars in such a way that you are able to choose an optimal car, travel the clockwise distance N and return to the place where you were initially. Under this constraint, you want to pay the least possible number of coins. Find the smallest number of coins you need to pay. It is guaranteed that there is a way to travel the distance N. It can be proved that in such a case, the smallest number of coins is always an integer. Tags: Sorting Algorithms ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/GASOLINE,CC
Sleep Cycle ,"Chef has been studying the human sleep cycle for years. He divides a day into L units of time (numbered 1 through L). Chef's research shows that his body requires spending only H continuous units of time per day on sleep — then, he can stay active during work. However, in case of travel or any other responsibilities, he might not be able to achieve this ideal state. Next, Chef noticed that if he sleeps for x (x<Hx<Hx lt H) continuous units of time and then performs some other activity, he can still meet his daily sleep quota, but the remaining time he needs to spend on continuously sleeping becomes 2⋅(H−x)2⋅(H−x)2cdot(H-x). He can further split this sleeping time in the same way, i.e. if he now sleeps for y more (y<2⋅(H−x)y<2⋅(H−x)y lt 2cdot(H-x)) continuous units of time, his required sleeping time becomes 2⋅(2⋅(H−x)−y)2⋅(2⋅(H−x)−y)2cdot(2cdot(H-x)-y), and so on. You are given a string S with length L; for each valid i, the i-th character of this string is '0' if the i-th unit of time is free (so Chef can use it to sleep) or '1' if it is occupied. Can Chef ever get enough sleep to feel fresh during his work, given that he can choose when to sleep in his free time? Tags: String Data Structures ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/SLPCYCLE,CC
Chef and a great voluntary Program ,"Chef likes to eat apples and bananas a lot. Today, he is doing a voluntary service by providing these fruits to needy people in a lunger (a gathering of needy people). The people form a queue to collect fruits from Chef. Chef distributes each person one of the fruits either an apple or a banana. You are given information about the way Chef distributed fruits to the people by a string s, whose each character is either 'a' or 'b' denoting whether the corresponding person was distributed an apple or a banana. After the event Chef wants to analyze what he could have done to make the event memorable. The event will be memorable if everyone at the end is happy. Whenever a person in the queue get an apple or a banana then he will observe the most recent K fruits distributed (including fruits he previously took, but not counting the fruit he just got) and if all of them were same as the fruit he just got, then he becomes disgruntled. The value of K if the person is getting an apple is x, and similarly y for banana. To make all the people happy, Chef can change the order of distributing the fruits (apple and bananas) and also can give some people extra kiwi fruits. Since the kiwis are costly, Chef would want to minimize the number of kiwis he needed to distribute. Note that a person leaves the queue as soon as Chef distributes him either an apple or a banana. So Chef should provide a person some kiwis before providing an apple or a banana, otherwise Chef won't be able to provide him kiwi as they would have already left the queue. Help Chef in finding a way of distributing the fruits to the people that make everyone happy and requires Chef to buy as few kiwis as possible.

Meet In The Median ,"You're given a sequence of N distinct integers. You need to find a subsequence of length K with the maximum possible median. The median of a sequence is the value of the element which is in the middle of the sequence after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the length of the sequence is even, the left of two middle elements is selected. For example, if the sequence is [3,4,2,1,5][3,4,2,1,5][3, 4, 2, 1, 5], then the median is 3 since after sorting, it will look like [1,2,3,4,5][1,2,3,4,5][1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and 3 is the only middle element. The median of [4,2,1,5][4,2,1,5][4, 2, 1, 5] is 2 since after sorting, the value 2 is the left of the two middle elements 2 and 4. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, if the sequence is [2,1,4,5,7][2,1,4,5,7][2, 1, 4, 5, 7], then [1,5,7][1,5,7][1, 5, 7], [2,1,4][2,1,4][2, 1, 4], [5][5][5] are some valid subsequences but [4,1,2][4,1,2][4, 1, 2], [1,6,7][1,6,7][1, 6, 7] are not.

Chef and Ants ,"Chef has been researching ant colonies for many years and finally discovered all their secrets. An ant colony consists of N distinct lines (numbered 1 through N) that pass through a point OOmathsf{O}, which is the queen's home. For each valid i, there are MiMiM_i ants on the i-th line. For each valid i and j, the j-th ant on the i-th line initially has a non-zero coordinate Xi,jXi,jX_{i,j} with the following meaning: The distance of this ant from OOmathsf{O} is |Xi,j||Xi,j||X_{i,j}|. Let's choose a direction along the i-th line from OOmathsf{O}. The exact way in which this direction is chosen does not matter here, it only needs to be the same for all ants on the same line. If Xi,jXi,jX_{i,j} is positive, this ant is at the distance |Xi,j||Xi,j||X_{i,j}| from OOmathsf{O} in the chosen direction. Otherwise, it is at this distance from OOmathsf{O} in the opposite direction. In other words, two ants j and k on a line i are at the same side of OOmathsf{O} if the signs of Xi,jXi,jX_{i,j} and Xi,kXi,kX_{i,k} are the same or on opposite sides if the signs are different. All ants move with the same constant speed. Initially, all of them are moving towards OOmathsf{O}. Whenever two or more ants meet (possibly at OOmathsf{O}), all of these ants turn around and start moving in the opposite directions with the same speed. We call this a collision. Even if an ant reaches OOmathsf{O} without meeting an ant there, it keeps moving in the same direction. An ant may change direction multiple times. Help Chef find the total number of collisions between ants. Note that even if more than two ants meet, it counts as only one collision.

They are sitting in a line from left to right numbered through 1 to n. Malvika is sitting in the nth spot. She wants to teach m topics of competitive programming to the students. As the people taking part in the camp are all newbies, they know none of the topics being taught, i.e., initially, the first n - 1 people in the line know none of the topics, while the nth knows all of them. It takes one hour for a person to learn a topic from his neighbour. Obviously, one person cannot both teach a topic as well as learn one during the same hour. That is, in any particular hour, a person can either teach a topic that he knows to one of his neighbors, or he can learn a topic from one of his neighbors, or he can sit idly. It is also obvious that if person x is learning from person y at a particular hour, then person y must be teaching person x at that hour.

Chef and Job and Rest ,"Chef is working as a programmer.

Each book has some given number of pages, and Chef reads one page per minute independent of which page of whichever book it is. Chef has two types of books to read: the first type are too interesting for an interrupted read and, therefore, need to be finished in one continuous reading session, that is, some ith resting period or a part of it. Books of the second type are more casual reads which can be split up in any way between different resting periods (read a few pages, then read another book or do the job, and continue later). Chef is getting tired when switch, that is why each book can be read for some times only once per rest. Let us take an example: If Chef has a rest period array R = {4,1,1}, and books types to read: (1st, 3 min), (2nd, 3 min). Chef can finish the first book in the first rest period (minutes from 1st to 3rd), and use the 4th minute of first period, along with the second and third periods to finish the second book. Some books are part of a series, and need to be read in order. In other words, some books can't be started until some other books are done.

Little Elephant and Order ,"The Little Elephant loves lucky strings. Everybody knows that the lucky string is a string of digits that contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, strings ""47"", ""744"", ""4"" are lucky while ""5"", ""17"", ""467"" are not. The Little Elephant has the strings A and B of digits. These strings are of equal lengths, that is |A| = |B|. He wants to get some lucky string from them. For this he performs the following operations. At first he arbitrary reorders digits of A. Then he arbitrary reorders digits of B. After that he creates the string C such that its i-th digit is the maximum between the i-th digit of A and the i-th digit of B. In other words, C[i] = max{A[i], B[i]} for i from 1 to |A|. After that he removes from C all non-lucky digits saving the order of the remaining (lucky) digits. So C now becomes a lucky string. For example, if after reordering A = ""754"" and B = ""873"", then C is at first ""874"" and then it becomes ""74"". The Little Elephant wants the resulting string to be as lucky as possible. The formal definition of this is that the resulting string should be the lexicographically greatest possible string among all the strings that can be obtained from the given strings A and B by the described process. Notes |A| denotes the length of the string A. A[i] denotes the i-th digit of the string A. Here we numerate the digits starting from 1. So 1 ≤ i ≤ |A|. The string A is called lexicographically greater than the string B if either there exists some index i such that A[i] > B[i] and for each j < i we have A[j] = B[j], or B is a proper prefix of A, that is, |A| > |B| and first |B| digits of A coincide with the corresponding digits of B.

Alien Invasion ,"Chef is the leader of Chef's Earth Defense Organization, and his mission is to counter aliens which are threatening the earth. According to information gathered by the organization, there are N alien spaceships (numbered 1 through N) planning to invade the earth. The i-th spaceship will appear on the radar at time CiCiC_i. Each spaceship needs D time to reach earth once it appears on the radar. Chef's organization owns a huge laser cannon which can destroy one spaceship in one shot. However, once the cannon is used once it needs some amount of cool-down time in order to be used again (first shot doesn't require cool-down time before it is used). This cool-down time, however, is configurable. It has to be set before the first shot, and cannot be changed after that. If Chef sets a lower cool-down time, that would increase the energy consumed by the cannon, and vice-versa - the higher the cool-down time, the lower the energy consumed. This might be a long battle, and Chef wants to use as little energy as possible. So Chef wants to maximize the cool-down time while still being able to destroy all spaceships before any of them arrive on earth.

The mountain range can be modeled by a polyline in the 2D xzxzxz plane that passes through N points p1=(1,h1),p2=(2,h2),…,pN=(N,hN)p1=(1,h1),p2=(2,h2),…,pN=(N,hN)p_1 = (1,h_1), p_2 = (2, h_2), ldots, p_N = (N, h_N), in this order, where hihih_i is a positive integer for each valid i. This polyline divides the set of points {(x,z):1≤x≤N}{(x,z):1≤x≤N}{(x, z): 1 le x le N} into two regions. The ""solid"" part of the mountain range is the ""bottom"" region, i.e. the region that contains the x-axis (the x-axis is the line z=0z=0z=0). A dragon's den is located at each of the N points. For each valid i, the den at the point pipip_i initially contains a pile of spices with tastiness aiaia_i. With a technique he learned from dragons, Chef can glide from den to den, tasting all of the spices along the way. The tastiness of an entire journey is the summed up tastiness of spices over all dens visited during the journey. However, there are some restrictions: Chef can only glide from a higher den to a strictly lower den, i.e. if he glides from a den at pipip_i to a den at pjpjp_j, then hi>hjhi>hjh_i gt h_j must hold. Chef can only glide in one direction and never look back, i.e. if he starts travelling in the direction of decreasing x, he must keep travelling in that direction until the end of the journey, and if he starts travelling in the direction of increasing x, he must keep travelling in that direction until the end of the journey too. Chef cannot travel through solid mountain, i.e. he can only glide from a den at pipip_i to a den at pjpjp_j if the line segment connecting the points pipip_i and pjpjp_j does not intersect the ""solid"" part of the mountain range. However, it may touch the border of the mountain range, i.e. the polyline itself. Note that gliding is the only way for Chef to travel between dens. It is valid for a journey to begin and end at the same den, in which case Chef tastes the spices at the den and nothing else. See the explanation of the sample test case for a concrete example. With that in mind, Chef needs you to process Q queries. There are two types of queries: 1 b k: Chef changes his mind and decides that the tastiness of the spices in the den at the point pbpbp_b should be changed to k instead. 2 b c: Chef wants to start a journey at the den located at pbpbp_b and end it at the den located at pcpcp_c. Find the maximum possible tastiness of such a journey or determine that no such journey exists.

Doom Bakes Cakes ,"From the FAQ: What am I allowed to post as a comment for a problem? Do NOT post code. Do NOT post a comment asking why your solution is wrong. Do NOT post a comment asking if you can be given the test case your program fails on. Do NOT post a comment asking how your solution can be improved. Do NOT post a comment giving any hints or discussing approaches to the problem, or what type or speed of algorithm is required. Problem Statement Chef Doom has decided to bake a circular cake. He wants to place N colored cherries around the cake in a circular manner. As all great chefs do, Doom doesn't want any two adjacent cherries to have the same color. Chef has unlimited supply of cherries of K ≤ 10 different colors. Each color is denoted by the digit from the set {0, 1, ., K – 1}. Different colors are denoted by different digits. Some of the cherries are already placed and the Chef wants you to place cherries in the remaining positions. He understands that there can be many such arrangements, so in the case when the answer is not unique he asks you to find the lexicographically smallest one. What does it mean? Let's numerate positions for the cherries by the numbers 1, 2, ., N starting from one of the positions in a clockwise direction. Then the current (possibly partial) arrangement of the cherries can be represented by a string of N characters. For each position i of the arrangement if the cherry of the color C is placed at this position then the ith character of the string is equal to the digit C. Otherwise, it is equal to the question mark ?. We identify the arrangement with the string that represents it. One arrangement is called lexicographically smaller than the other arrangement if at the first position where they differ the first one has smaller digit (we compare only complete arrangements so we don't care about relation between digits and the question mark). For example, the arrangement 1230123 is lexicographically smaller than 1231230 since they have first 3 equal characters but the 4th character in the first arrangement is 0 and it is less than 1 which is the 4th character of the second arrangement. Notes The cherries at the first and the last positions are adjacent to each other (recall that we have a circular cake). In the case N = 1 any arrangement is valid as long as the color used for the only cherry of this arrangement is less than K. Initial arrangement can be already invalid (see the case 3 in the example). Just to make all things clear. You will be given a usual string of digits and question marks. Don't be confused by circular stuff we have in this problem. You don't have to rotate the answer once you have replaced all question marks by the digits. Think of the output like the usual string for which each two consecutive digits must be different but having additional condition that the first and the last digits must be also different (of course if N > 1). Next, you don't have to use all colors. The only important condition is that this string should be lexicographically smaller than all other strings that can be obtained from the input string by replacement of question marks by digits and of course it must satisfy conditions on adjacent digits. One more thing, K here is not the length of the string but the number of allowed colors. Also we emphasize that the given string can have arbitrary number of question marks. So it can have zero number of question marks as well as completely consists of question marks but of course in general situation it can have both digits and question marks. OK. Let's try to formalize things in order to make all even more clear. You will be given an integer K and a string S=S[1]S[2].S[N] where each S[i] is either the decimal digit less than K or the question mark. We are serious. In all tests string S can have only digits less than K. Don't ask about what to do if we have digit ≥ K. There are no such tests at all! We guarantee this! OK, let's continue. Your task is to replace each question mark by some digit strictly less than K. If there were no question marks in the string skip this step. Now if N=1 then your string is already valid. For N > 1 it must satisfy the following N conditions S[1] ≠ S[2], S[2] ≠ S[3], ., S[N-1] ≠ S[N], S[N] ≠ S[1]. Among all such valid strings that can be obtained by replacement of question marks you should choose lexicographically smallest one. I hope now the problem is really clear.

You are given information of their arrangement by a string s. The string s consists of only letters 'B' and 'G', where 'B' represents a boy and 'G' represents a girl. Devu wants inter-gender interaction among his class should to be maximum. So he does not like seeing two or more boys/girls standing nearby (i.e. continuous) in the line. e.g. he does not like the arrangements BBG and GBB, but he likes BG, GBG etc. Now by seeing the initial arrangement s of students, Devu may get furious and now he wants to change this arrangement into a likable arrangement. For achieving that, he can swap positions of any two students (not necessary continuous). Let the cost of swapping people from position i with position j (i ≠ j) be c(i, j). You are provided an integer variable type, then the cost of the the swap will be defined by c(i, j) = |j − i|type. Please help Devu in finding minimum cost of swaps needed to convert the current arrangement into a likable one.

Knapsack Problem ,"Mike takes part in programming contests. His favourite topic is dynamic programming(DP). As he said, that he likes problems on DP, because ""you spend a lot of time on thinking and a little time on coding"". In this problem you are to solve a version of the knapsack problem(link), one of the most famous examples of DP problem. You are given N items, each has two parameters: a weight and a cost. Let's define M as the sum of the weights of all the items. Your task is to determine the most expensive cost of a knapsack, which capacity equals to 1, 2, ., M. A cost of a knapsack equals to the sum of the costs of all the elements of the knapsack.

Friend Groups In A Line ,"There are N positions in a queue. Given a binary string S of length N, where Si=Si=S_i = '1' denotes, there is a person standing in the ithithi^{th} position. The distance between two people standing in the ithithi^{th} and jthjthj^{th} positions respectively in the queue is ∣i−j∣∣i−j∣mid i - j mid, where ∣x∣∣x∣mid x mid denotes the absolute value of x. Now, two people are considered to be friends if they are at a distance less than or equal to K. Let's say, there are M people, P1,P2,…,PMP1,P2,…,PMP_1, P_2, dots, P_M standing one after another in a queue such that for each 1≤i<M1≤i<M1 leq i lt M, PiPiP_i and Pi+1Pi+1P_{i+1} are friends, then all the M people are considered to be in a friend group.

Protecting The Poison ,"The kingdom of the snakes is an NxN grid. Their most-valued possession is a huge collection of poison, which is stored in the central KxK grid. It is guaranteed that both N and K are odd. What we mean by 'central' is this: suppose in the NxN grid, (i, j) refers to the cell in the i-th row and j-th column and (1,1) refers to the top-left corner and (N,N) refers to the bottom-right corner. Then the poison is stored in the KxK square whose top-left corner is ( (N - K)/2 + 1, (N - K)/2 + 1 ). But there are thieves who want to steal the poison. They cannot enter the NxN grid, but they can shoot arrows from outside. These arrows travel across a row (from left to right, or right to left), or across a column (top to bottom or bottom to top) in a straight line. If the arrow enters the KxK grid, some of the poison will stick to the arrow, and if it exits the NxN grid after that, the thieves will have successfully stolen some of the poison. As the King of the snakes, you want to thwart these attempts. You know that the arrows will break and stop if they hit a snake's scaly skin, but won't hurt the snakes. There are some snakes already guarding the poison. Each snake occupies some consecutive cells in a straight line inside the NxN grid. That is, they are either part of a row, or part of a column. Note that there can be intersections between the snakes. A configuration of snakes is 'safe', if the thieves cannot steal poison. That is, no matter which row or column they shoot arrows from, either the arrow should hit a snake and stop (this can happen even after it has entered and exited the KxK grid), or it shouldn't ever enter the KxK grid. The King has other duties for the snakes, and hence wants to remove as many snakes as possible from this configuration, such that the remaining configuration is still 'safe'. Help him find the minimum number of snakes he needs to leave behind to protect the poison. Tags: Geometry, Greedy, Sorting Mathematics, Algorithms ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/PROTEPOI,CC

For any such assignment, we define DiDiD_i to be the number of neighbours j of i such that Cj<CiCj<CiC_j < C_i. You want to minimise maxi∈{1..N}Di−mini∈{1..N}Dimaxi∈{1..N}Di−mini∈{1..N}Di{max_{i in {1..N}} D_i} - {min_{i in {1..N}} D_i}. Output the minimum possible value of this expression for a valid assignment as described above, and also print the corresponding assignment. Note: The given graph need not be connected. If there are multiple possible assignments, output anyone. Since the input is large, prefer using fast input-output methods.

Arranging the Inventory ,"Chef has an inventory, which can be represented as a row of N cells (numbered 1 through N). Each cell is either empty or contains a box. Chef wants to rearrange the boxes in such a way that they are all on the left side of the inventory (so if there are K boxes, they should occupy the leftmost K cells). He may perform two types of moves: choose a cell i (1≤i≤N−21≤i≤N−21 le i le N-2); if cells i and i+2i+2i+2 are empty and cell i+1i+1i+1 contains a box, Chef stands in cell i+2i+2i+2 and pushes the box from cell i+1i+1i+1 to cell i choose a cell i (1≤i≤N−21≤i≤N−21 le i le N-2); if cells i+1i+1i+1 and i+2i+2i+2 are empty and cell i contains a box, Chef stands in cell i+1i+1i+1 and pulls the box in cell i to cell i+1i+1i+1 The moves may be performed in any order, any number of times (possibly zero).

Rainbow Graph ,"You are given an undirected compete graph with n nodes. Each edge can be one of n*(n-1)/2 +1 different colors. These colors are labeled from 0 to n*(n-1)/2, inclusive. But not all these n*(n-1)/2 +1 colors need to be used. ie. it is possible that two different edges could have the same color. Formally, let ci,j denote the color between the i-th and j-th nodes. (Note that these edges are undirected, so ci,j = cj,i). We will define ci,i to be zero, although there is no such edge present. i.e. the graph does not contain self-loops. A subset of nodes is called interesting if every node in the subset has at least two edges of different colors, connecting it to vertices in the subset. Your task is to determine the maximum possible size of an interesting subset of nodes. Note that, by definition, the empty subset of nodes is an interesting subset, and so the answer is always at least zero.

His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform the first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one. Chef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R). Chef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him.

The Biggest Restaurant ,"Chef Ada is building a new restaurant in the following way: First, N points X1,X2,…,XNX1,X2,…,XNX_1, X_2, ldots, X_N are chosen on the x-axis. Then, N columns (numbered 1 through N) are made. For simplicity, the columns are represented as vertical segments; for each valid i, the height of the i-th segment is HiHiH_i. Ada assigns a column to each of the points X1,X2,…,XNX1,X2,…,XNX_1, X_2, ldots, X_N in an arbitrary way (each column must be assigned to exactly one point). Finally, Ada constructs the roof of the restaurant, represented by a polyline with N vertices. Let's denote the column assigned to the i-th point by PiPiP_i. For each valid i, the i-th of these vertices is (Xi,HPi)(Xi,HPi)(X_i, H_{P_i}), i.e. the polyline joins the tops of the columns from left to right. Ada wants the biggest restaurant. Help her choose the positions of the columns in such a way that the area below the roof is the biggest possible.

Chef and Escaping from the Labyrinth ,"Chef has fallen into the Labyrinth! Fortunately, Chef found a map of the Labyrinth. On this map, the Labyrinth is represented as an N × M grid of integers. The rows of the grid are numbered 1 through N and the columns are numbered 1 through M; let's denote the cell in the i-th row and j-th column by (i, j). Each cell of this grid belongs to one of the following three types: Forbidden cell (represented by -1). It's impossible to enter or exit this cell. Empty cell (represented by 0). Chef can freely enter or exit this cell, but cannot use it to escape the Labyrinth. Exit cell (represented by a positive integer x). Chef can freely enter or exit this cell. Moreover, Chef can escape the Labyrinth if he's located in this cell and no more than x seconds have elapsed since the beginning. Chef is able to move from his current cell to any non-forbidden adjacent cell of the Labyrinth; this action takes one second. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share an edge. Chef does not even know his starting location, so he decided first to determine his chances of escaping from each possible cell. Specifically, for each non-forbidden cell, Chef wants to know whether it is possible to escape the Labyrinth when he's initially (at time 0) located in this cell.

Strings and Graphs ,"Consider a sequence of positive integers A = (A1, A2, . , AN), and another sequence B = (B1, B2, . , BM). We say that B is a subsequence of A, if B can be written as (Ai1, Ai2, . , AiM), where 1 ≤ i1 < i2 . < iM ≤ N. If B is a subsequence of A, there could be multiple ways to write it in such a manner, and among all those ways, we choose the way which minimizes iM. We call this minimized iM to be f(B). Note that in the definition of f(B), we are assuming that A is a constant. Also, when B is the empty sequence, it is considered to be a subsequence of A, and f(B) would then be 0. Now, given A, we will construct a graph G which has N + 1 nodes and labeled directed edges. The nodes are {V0, V1, ., VN}. If there are two subsequences of A: C1 and C2, such that C2 is obtained by appending the integer b at the end of C1, and f(C1) ≠ f(C2), then the edge ( Vf(C1), b, Vf(C2) ) is added to the graph G if it is not already present in the graph. (Note that even if an edge with a different label is already present, this edge is added. Just that there will not be multiple edges from one vertex to another with the same label). The edge (Vi, b, Vj) means that it is a directed edge from Vi to Vj, and it has the label b. Chef constructed this graph, but then lost the sequence A, as well as all the labels on the graph. So all he has left is a directed graph (with possibly multiple edges from one vertex to another), and now he wants to find the sequence A.

Password Cracking Challenge ,"Chef has recently discovered a weakness in the password verification system on a network of servers, and has enlisted your help in determining the practicality of an attack. Chef discovered that if he simultaneously sends password guesses to all servers, he can measure the response time to determine how accurately the guesses were. Some of the servers in the network are ""honeypot"" servers that accept password guesses but cannot be accessed. Chef does not know which servers are honeypots, but he knows how many there are. Each server has a password consisting of between 8 and 12 lowercase alphabetic characters. There is also a ""salt"" string which is 8 characters long. When a password guess comes to a server, the password guess is appended with the salt string, and then hashed with the SHA1 hashing algorithm. (Most of the details of the SHA1 hashing algorithm are not relevant to this problem, other than the fact that it has an output size of 160 bits, each of which equally likely to be 0 or 1.) The result is compared to the SHA1 hash of the actual password appended with the salt string. Chef is able to calculate the sum of the squares of the number of matching bits on each non-honeypot server (after all, the honeypot servers don't give any feedback). This sum is denoted the ""score"" of a guess. There is a limit on the number of password guesses Chef can make. Chef would like you to make password guesses, and try to attain a high guess score.

Compilers and parsers ,"Lira is now very keen on compiler development. :) She knows that one of the most important components of a compiler, is its parser. A parser is, in simple terms, a software component that processes text, and checks it's semantic correctness, or, if you prefer, if the text is properly built. As an example, in declaring and initializing an integer, in C/C++, you can't do something like: int = x ;4 as the semantics of such statement is incorrect, as we all know that the datatype must precede an identifier and only afterwards should come the equal sign and the initialization value, so, the corrected statement should be: int x = 4; Today, Lira is concerned with an abstract instruction which is composed of the characters ""<"" and "">"" , which she will use on the design of her language, L++ :D. She is using it as an abstraction for generating XML code Tags in an easier fashion and she understood that, for an expression to be valid, a ""<"" symbol must always have a corresponding "">"" character somewhere (not necessary immediately) after it. Moreover, each "">"" symbol should correspond to exactly one ""<"" symbol. So, for instance, the instructions: <<>> <> <><> are all valid. While: >> ><>< are not. Given some expressions which represent some instructions to be analyzed by Lira's compiler, you should tell the length of the longest prefix of each of these expressions that is valid, or 0 if there's no such a prefix.

Pintu and Fruits ,"Chef went to Australia and saw the destruction caused by bushfires, which made him sad, so he decided to help the animals by feeding them fruits. First, he went to purchase fruits from Pintu. Pintu sells M different types of fruits (numbered 1 through M). He sells them in N baskets (numbered 1 through N), where for each valid i, the i-th basket costs PiPiP_i and it contains fruits of type FiFiF_i. Chef does not have too much money, so he cannot afford to buy everything; instead, he wants to choose one of the M available types and purchase all the baskets containing fruits of that type. Help Chef choose the type of fruit to buy such that he buys at least one basket and the total cost of the baskets he buys is the smallest possible.

Chef and Typing ,"Chef is practising his typing skills since his current typing speed is very low. He uses a training application that displays some words one by one for Chef to type. When typing a word, Chef takes 0.2 seconds to type the first character; for each other character of this word, he takes 0.2 seconds to type this character if it is written with a different hand than the previous character, or 0.4 seconds if it is written with the same hand. The time taken to type a word is the sum of times taken to type all of its characters. However, if a word has already appeared during practice, Chef can type it in half the time it took him to type this word for the first time. Currently, Chef is practising in easy mode, which only uses words that consists of characters 'd', 'f', 'j' and 'k'. The characters 'd' and 'f' are written using the left hand, while the characters 'j' and 'k' are written using the right hand.

For e.g. if A=[2,0,1,6,2,1,3,0,7]A=[2,0,1,6,2,1,3,0,7]A = [2, 0, 1, 6, 2, 1, 3, 0, 7], then one way in which Chef can select subarrays is as following: [0,1],[1,3,0][0,1],[1,3,0]{[0, 1], [1, 3, 0]} (Here mexmexmex of both of them is 2). Chef wants to select the maximum number of disjoint, non-empty subarrays that satisfy the above condition. Can you help him to do so? Note: An array X is called a subarray of an array Y if X can be obtained from Y by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Also, mexmexmex of a subarray is the smallest non-negative number that does not occur in that subarray. Tags: ad-hoc, cook139, mex, simple, ved_ansh ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/MEXSPLIT,CC

Chef and Apple Trees ,"Chef loves to prepare delicious dishes. This time, Chef has decided to prepare a special dish for you, and needs to gather several apples to do so. Chef has N apple trees in his home garden. Each tree has a certain (non-zero) number of apples on it. In order to create his dish, Chef wants to pluck every apple from every tree. Chef has an unusual method of collecting apples. In a single minute, he can perform the following task: Pick any subset of trees such that every tree in the subset has the same number of apples. From each tree in the subset, pluck any number of apples, as long as the number of apples left on the tree equals the number of apples on a tree not in the subset. If all trees have the same number of apples left, Chef can pluck all of the apples remaining in a single minute.

When Chef returned home, he was angry to see that all of his piles didn't contain equal number of coins as he very strongly believes in the policy of equality for all, may it be people or piles of coins. In order to calm down the Chef, the assistant proposes to make all the piles equal. Chef agrees to give this task to him, but as a punishment gives him only two type of operations that he can perform. Pick some coins from any pile and put them back in Chef's coin box.

At the Gates ,"You are Dastan, the great Prince of Persia! After searching long for the mysterious 'Sands of Time', you have finally arrived at the gates of the city that hosts the ancient temple of the gods. However, the gate is locked and it can only be opened with a secret code, which you need to obtain by solving the following puzzle: There is a table in front of you, with N coins placed in a row and numbered 1 through N from left to right. For each coin, you know whether it is initially showing heads or tails. You have to perform exactly K operations. In one operation, you should remove the rightmost coin present on the table, and if this coin was showing heads right before it was removed, then you should also flip all the remaining coins. (If a coin was showing heads, then after it is flipped, it is showing tails, and vice versa.) The code needed to enter the temple is the number of coins which, after these K operations are performed, have not been removed and are showing heads. Can you find this number?

The Ball And Cups ,"At the end of a busy day, The Chef and his assistants play a game together. The game is not just for fun but also used to decide who will have to clean the kitchen. The Chef is a Game Master, so his concern is how to manage the game but not how to win the game like his assistants do. The game requires players to find the only ball under one of the N cups after their positions are changed in a special way. At the beginning of the game, The Chef places N cups in a row and put a ball under the C-th cup from the left (the cups are numbered from 1 to N). All players can see the initial position of the ball. Then Chef performs Q flip operations. Each flip operation is defined by two integers L and R such that 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N and consists in reversing the segment [L, R] of cups. Namely, Chef swaps L-th and R-th cups, (L+1)-th and (R−1)-th cups, and so on. After performing all the operations Chef asks his assistants to choose a cup that they think the ball is under it. Who can guess the position of the ball will win the game, and of course, the others will have to clean the kitchen. The Chef doesn't want to check all the N cups at the end of the game.

This way, only the root has the level equal to 1, while only its two sons has the level equal to 2. Then, let's take all the nodes with the odd level and enumerate them with consecutive odd numbers, starting from the smallest levels and the leftmost nodes, going to the rightmost nodes and the highest levels. Then, let's take all the nodes with the even level and enumerate them with consecutive even numbers, starting from the smallest levels and the leftmost nodes, going to the rightmost nodes and the highest levels.

For example, in odd levels, the root was enumerated first, then, there were enumerated roots' left sons' sons and roots' right sons' sons. You are given the string of symbols, let's call it S. Each symbol is either l or r. Naturally, this sequence denotes some path from the root, where l means going to the left son and r means going to the right son.

Attic Crossing ,"Digory Kirke and Polly Plummer are two kids living next door to each other. The attics of the two houses are connected to each other through a passage. Digory's Uncle Andrew has been secretly doing strange things in the attic of his house, and he always ensures that the room is locked. Being curious, Digory suspects that there is another route into the attic through Polly's house, and being curious as kids always are, they wish to find out what it is that Uncle Andrew is secretly up to. So they start from Polly's house, and walk along the passageway to Digory's. Unfortunately, along the way, they suddenly find that some of the floorboards are missing, and that taking a step forward would have them plummet to their deaths below. Dejected, but determined, they return to Polly's house, and decide to practice long-jumping in the yard before they re-attempt the crossing of the passage. It takes them exactly one day to master long-jumping a certain length. Also, once they have mastered jumping a particular length L, they are able to jump any amount less than equal to L as well. The next day they return to their mission, but somehow find that there is another place further up the passage, that requires them to jump even more than they had practiced for. So they go back and repeat the process. Note the following: At each point, they are able to sense only how much they need to jump at that point, and have no idea of the further reaches of the passage till they reach there. That is, they are able to only see how far ahead is the next floorboard. The amount they choose to practice for their jump is exactly the amount they need to get across that particular part of the passage. That is, if they can currently jump upto a length L0, and they require to jump a length L1(> L0) at that point, they will practice jumping length L1 that day. They start by being able to ""jump"" a length of 1. Find how many days it will take them to cross the passageway. In the input, the passageway is described as a string P of '#'s and '.'s. A '#' represents a floorboard, while a '.' represents the absence of a floorboard. The string, when read from left to right, describes the passage from Polly's house to Digory's, and not vice-versa.

Chef remembers that he played such game: On each step he choose an index x from 1 to n. For all indices y (y < x) he calculated the difference by = ax - ay. Then he calculated B1 - sum of all by which are greater than 0 and B2 - sum of all by which are less than 0. The answer for this step is B1 - B2. Chef remembers the game, but forgot the answer.

Reservior ,"You are given a structure of a water reservoir. The reservoir is a 2 dimensional structure of height N and width M. It can be thought of divided into M vertical sections, each of equal width. The reservoir height is of N blocks. Each block of the reservoir can contain either water, brick or air. We will denote the water by character 'W', brick by 'B' and air by 'A'. You are given representation of reservoir at a fixed instant. Can you tell whether the current state of reservoir is stable, i.e. it will remain on the same state forever or not? For example, let the reservoir be WW BB This is not stable, as the water in the block (1, 1) can overflow to the left, similarly water in block (1, 2) can overflow to the right too. BWB B This is stable, as the water at block (1, 2) is entrapped between bricks from all sides. AWA B This is not stable, as the water at block (1, 2) might overflow to the left or the right. BAA ABB This is not stable, as there is a brick at block (1, 1) and air at (2, 1). The brick will go down and air will come up, so its not stable too. BWAAB BWBWB B This is not stable too, as there is water at block (1, 2) and air at (1, 3), and (1, 4). The water will move towards those blocks. B BAB B So brick at (1, 2) is loose and without support, and hence will fill the space beneath it, which is right now filled with air. That is, the brick will go down and replace the air B BWB B This is also unstable due to the same reason as the above. Now, you are given description of reservoir. Can you tell whether the current state of reservoir is stable or not? Tags: Matrices, Implementation Mathematics, Algorithms ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/RESERVOI,CC

Forgot Password ,"Chef changed the password of his laptop a few days ago, but he can't remember it today. Luckily, he wrote the encrypted password on a piece of paper, along with the rules for decryption. The encrypted password is a string S consists of ASCII printable characters except space (ASCII 33 - 126, in decimal notation, the same below). Read here for more details: ASCII printable characters. Each rule contains a pair of characters ci, pi, denoting that every character ci appears in the encrypted password should be replaced with pi. Notice that it is not allowed to do multiple replacements on a single position, see example case 1 for clarification. After all the character replacements, the string is guaranteed to be a positive decimal number. The shortest notation of this number is the real password. To get the shortest notation, we should delete all the unnecessary leading and trailing zeros. If the number contains only non-zero fractional part, the integral part should be omitted (the shortest notation of ""0.5"" is "".5""). If the number contains zero fractional part, the decimal point should be omitted as well (the shortest notation of ""5.00"" is ""5""). Please help Chef to find the real password.

Sebi and the highway ,"Sebi goes to school daily with his father. They cross a big highway in the car to reach to the school. Sebi sits in front seat beside his father at driving seat. To kill boredom, they play a game of guessing speed of other cars on the highway. Sebi makes a guess of other car's speed being SG kph, his father FG kph. The highway is usually empty, so the drivers use cruise control, i.e. vehicles run at a constant speed. There are markers on the highway at a gap of 50 meters. Both father-son duo wants to check the accuracy of their guesses. For that, they start a timer at the instant at which their car and the other car (which speed they are guessing) are parallel to each other (they need not to be against some marker, they can be in between the markers too). After some T seconds, they observe that both the cars are next to some markers and the number of markers in between the markers of their car and the other car is D - 1 (excluding the markers next to both the cars). Also, they can observe these markers easily because the other car is faster than their. Speed of Sebi's father's car is S. Using this information, one can find the speed of the other car accurately. An example situation when Sebi's father starts the timer. Notice that both the car's are parallel to each other. Example situation after T seconds. The cars are next to the markers. Here the value of D is 1. The green car is Sebi's and the other car is of blue color. Sebi's a child, he does not know how to find the check whose guess is close to the real speed of the car. He does not trust his father as he thinks that he might cheat. Can you help to resolve this issue between them by telling whose guess is closer. If Sebi's guess is better, output ""SEBI"".

Chef and Walking on the rectangle ,"Chef likes rectangles. Among all possible rectangles, he loves rectangles that can be drawn like a grid, such that they have N rows and M columns. Grids are common in Byteland. Hence, Chef has drawn such a rectangle and plans on moving around in it. The rows of the rectangle are labeled from 1 to N from top to bottom. The columns of the rectangle are labeled form 1 to M from left to right. Thus, the cell in the top left can be denoted by (1,1). The 5th cell from the left in the 4th row form the top can be denoted by (4,5). The bottom right cell can be denoted as (N,M). Chef wants to move from the cell in the top left to the cell in the bottom right. In each move, Chef may only move one cell right, or one cell down. Also, Chef is not allowed to move to any cell outside the boundary of the rectangle. Of course, there are many ways for Chef to move from (1,1) to (N,M). Chef has a curious sport. While going from (1,1) to (N,M), he drops a stone on each of the cells he steps on, except the cells (1,1) and (N,M). Also, Chef repeats this game exactly K times. Let us say he moved from (1,1) to (N,M), exactly K times. At the end of all the K journeys, let the number of stones, in the cell with the maximum number of stones, be equal to S.

Divide the Tangerine ,"Once Chef decided to divide the tangerine into several parts. At first, he numbered tangerine's segments from 1 to n in the clockwise order starting from some segment. Then he intended to divide the fruit into several parts. In order to do it he planned to separate the neighbouring segments in k places, so that he could get k parts: the 1st - from segment l1 to segment r1 (inclusive), the 2nd - from l2 to r2, ., the kth - from lk to rk (in all cases in the clockwise order). Suddenly, when Chef was absent, one naughty boy came and divided the tangerine into p parts (also by separating the neighbouring segments one from another): the 1st - from segment a1 to segment b1, the 2nd - from a2 to b2, ., the pth - from ap to bp (in all cases in the clockwise order). Chef became very angry about it! But maybe little boy haven't done anything wrong, maybe everything is OK? Please, help Chef to determine whether he is able to obtain the parts he wanted to have (in order to do it he can divide p current parts, but, of course, he can't join several parts into one). Please, note that parts are not cyclic. That means that even if the tangerine division consists of only one part, but that part include more than one segment, there are two segments which were neighbouring in the initial tangerine but are not neighbouring in the division.

Shopping ,"This is an interactive problem. Please refer to ""Interactivity details"" section in order to get acquainted with the IO format. Good luck! About two years ago, Sergey has bought a wallet. Since then, he's constantly facing kind of difficulty, when he pays for something. The main reason is that the wallet doesn't have much sections in it, but Sergey, trying to be neat, always wants to keep his money in the sorted order. For example, he doesn't want to put the 50,0 burles bank note between two 100,0 burles bank notes. So, any time he gets the change, he finds the appropriate place in the wallet for each bank note, that might be very slow and irritating for both the cashier and for the next person in the queue, and our protagonist does not like it. Now it is time to change something! Of course, he could just order a credit card or more spacious wallet, but as the person who loves adventures, Sergey has decided to go another way. Now, in Sergey's country, there are N types of bank notes. The smallest bank note's value is 1 burle. The value of the bank note of the i-th type is Vi burles. Initially, Sergey has Ai bank notes of the value of Vi. Our protagonist plans all the purchases very well. For every his visit to the shop, he'll know the amount of money he's going to spend and will report it to you, right before the visit to this shop. The purchase proceeds in the following way: First, Sergey gives some amount of money to the cashier. This amount should not be less than the value of the purchase (obviously). Of course, Sergey is free to choose the way he'll collect the amount he's going to give, for example he can give 100,0 burles as one bank note of 100,0 burles, or he can use 1,0 bank notes of the value of 100 burles, or he can use 500 bank notes of the value of 100 burles and one bank note of the valie of 50,0 burles, etc. It will always be possible to give the amount, not less that the required. Then the cashier gives the change according to the following algorithm: first she gives as much bank notes of the largest value as possible in such a way that the given amount doesn't exceed the value of change, then she gives as much bank notes of the second largest value as possible in such a way that the given amount (considering previously given bank notes of the largest value, as well) doesn't exceed the amount of the change, and so on. Cashiers are provided with infinite number of bank notes of each type, and Sergey knows it well. In other words, cashiers collect the change greedily. Since there is a bank note of the value of 1, this algorithm will always be enough to collect the change correctly. Then, as the time goes, Sergey receives some more money. It can be a scholarship (he's a student), or anything else. Sergey knows the amount of money he's going to get any of these times. For getting it, there are a few ATMs in the city. The ATMs are not as good as cashiers, so each of them has infinite supply of some set of bank notes, but, possibly, not all the kinds. So each time, Sergey receives some money, he chooses the ATM where he wants to get it, and gets the whole amount from the specified ATM. Nevertheless, all the ATMs has supply of the bank note of the value of 1, so it's possible to receive the required amount of money from any of them. It needs to be pointed out that when Sergey receives some money, he collects it from the chosen ATM immediately. The ATMs work the same way as the cashiers when collect a change. Sometimes, new bank notes are issued by Sergey's country National Bank. Sergey will provide you the information about such events as well. You can consider that after the new bank note is introduced, all the shops has infinite supply of this bank note immediately. Finally, some new ATMs might also be built. For each of them, the list of present bank notes will be given. Sergey explored the bank's website and gathered all the information about the new ATMs. Now, Sergey asks you to develop the strategy of how much money he needs to give, and using which bank notes; and which ATMs to use in order to minimize the total amount of bank notes that will be given to him as a change. Test data information There are 20 test cases in total. The test cases are separated in 5 groups: Group 1: 1 ≤ E ≤ 100, 1 ≤ Vi ≤ 10. Moreover, you can assume that Sergey will neither spend nor receive more than 10 burles at once. Group 2: 1 ≤ E ≤ 10, 1 ≤ Vi ≤ 10, you can assume that Sergey will neither spend nor receive more than 106 burles at once. Group 3: 1 ≤ E ≤ 100, 1 ≤ Vi ≤ 106, you can assume that Sergey will neither spend nor receive more than 108 burles at once. Group 4: 1 ≤ E ≤ 10, 1 ≤ Vi ≤ 106, you can assume that Sergey will neither spend nor receive more than 4 * 108 burles at once. Group 5: 1 ≤ E ≤ 104, 1 ≤ Vi ≤ 106, you can assume that Sergey will neither spend nor receive more than 109 burles at once. Each group consists of 4 test cases. Moreover, the following will be held in all the test cases: 0 ≤ Ai ≤ 104 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 20 At the end of all the operations, there will be no more than 61 different bank notes' values and no more than 61 ATMs. During the contest, you will only see the score on the following test set (that is 20% of the test data): One test case from the first group. One test case from the second group. One test case from the third group. One test case from the fourth group. The problem will be rejudged on the full test set after the end of the competition. The score is the total amount of bank notes that will be given to Sergey by cashiers as a change. You need to minimize it.

Qualifying to Pre-Elimination ,"Snackdown 2019 is coming! There are two rounds (round A and round B) after the qualification round. From both of them, teams can qualify to the pre-elimination round. According to the rules, in each of these two rounds, teams are sorted in descending order by their score and each team with a score greater or equal to the score of the team at the K=1500K=1500K=1500-th place advances to the pre-elimination round (this means it is possible to have more than K qualified teams from each round in the case of one or more ties after the K-th place). Today, the organizers ask you to count the number of teams which would qualify for the pre-elimination round from round A for a given value of K (possibly different from 150015001500). They provided the scores of all teams to you; you should ensure that all teams scoring at least as many points as the K-th team qualify.

No Time to Wait ,"Only x hours are left for the March Long Challenge and Chef is only left with the last problem unsolved. However, he is sure that he cannot solve the problem in the remaining time. From experience, he figures out that he needs exactly H hours to solve the problem. Now Chef finally decides to use his special power which he has gained through years of intense yoga. He can travel back in time when he concentrates. Specifically, his power allows him to travel to N different time zones, which are T1,T2,…,TNT1,T2,…,TNT_1, T_2, ldots, T_N hours respectively behind his current time. Find out whether Chef can use one of the available time zones to solve the problem and submit it before the contest ends.

COVID Pandemic and Long Queue ,"Due to the COVID pandemic, people have been advised to stay at least 6 feet away from any other person. Now, people are lining up in a queue at the local shop and it is your duty to check whether they are all following this advice. There are a total of N spots (numbered 1 through N) where people can stand in front of the local shop. The distance between each pair of adjacent spots is 1 foot. Each spot may be either empty or occupied; you are given a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,ANA_1, A_2, ldots, A_N, where for each valid i, Ai=0Ai=0A_i = 0 means that the i-th spot is empty, while Ai=1Ai=1A_i = 1 means that there is a person standing at this spot. It is guaranteed that the queue is not completely empty. For example, if N=11N=11N = 11 and the sequence A is (0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1)(0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1)(0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1), then this is a queue in which people are not following the advice because there are two people at a distance of just 3 feet from each other. You need to determine whether the people outside the local shop are following the social distancing advice or not. As long as some two people are standing at a distance smaller than 6 feet from each other, it is bad and you should report it, since social distancing is not being followed.

Covid Sampling (Challenge) ,"This is an interactive problem. You are given the task of finding people infected with COVID-19 among the whole population. There are a total of N2N2N^2 people and they are standing in a N×NN×NN times N matrix, one person per cell. Formally, for each i (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N1 le i le N) and j (1≤j≤N1≤j≤N1 le j le N), let's denote Ai,j=1Ai,j=1A_{i, j} = 1 if the person standing in the i-th row and j-th column of the matrix is infected or Ai,j=0Ai,j=0A_{i, j} = 0 otherwise. Additionally, it is known that the infection spreads randomly at first and does not spread anymore ― that is, each person was initially infected with a probability P/100P/100P/100, independently from all other people. You do not know the values of Ai,jAi,jA_{i, j} and your task is to find these values. You may ask up to Q queries (Q is specified in the Constraints section below). In each query, you should choose a submatrix containing all people in rows r1r1r_1 through r2r2r_2 and columns c1c1c_1 through c2c2c_2 inclusive; the grader responds with the number of infected people in the queried submatrix. Each query has a cost; see the section Scoring for this cost. You should find out exactly which people are infected and the sum of costs of all queries you make should be as small as possible. Interaction First, you should read a line containing a single integer T ― the number of test cases. The description of interaction for T test cases follows. For each test case, you must start by reading a line containing two space-separated integers N and P. Then, you may ask queries. To ask a query, print a line containing five space-separated integers 1, r1r1r_1, c1c1c_1, r2r2r_2 and c2c2c_2. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer X. If X=−1X=−1X = -1, your query was invalid or you asked more than Q queries. Otherwise, X denotes the number of infected people. After asking queries, when you know the matrix A: Print a single line containing the integer 2. Then, print N lines. For each i (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N1 le i le N), the i-th of these lines should contain N space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,NAi,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,NA_{i, 1}, A_{i, 2}, ldots, A_{i, N}. Finally, you must read a line containing a single integer X. If your matrix A was correct, X=1X=1X = 1 and you should continue solving the remaining test cases. If it was incorrect, X=−1X=−1X = -1. At any point when you receieve X=−1X=−1X = -1, you should terminate your program immediately to receive the Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Constraints T=2T=2T = 2 N=60N=60N = 60 Q=5⋅N2=18,0Q=5⋅N2=18,0Q = 5 cdot N^2 = 18,0 Example Grader You 2 4 2 1 1 1 4 4 6 1 2 1 4 4 4 1 1 3 1 4 2 1 3 2 3 3 1 2 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 4 2 1 1 1 4 4 6 1 2 1 4 4 5 1 1 3 1 4 1 1 3 2 3 3 0 2 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 Explanation Example case 1: Note that this test case cannot appear in the actual test data because N=4N=4N = 4. It is only given for the sake of illustrating the interaction between your program and the grader. Test Data Generation There are four types of tests and five test files for each type. Type 1: P=2P=2P = 2 Type 2: P=5P=5P = 5 Type 3: P=10P=10P = 10 Type 4: P=15P=15P = 15 In each test case and for each valid i and j, Ai,jAi,jA_{i, j} is chosen to be 1 with probability P/100P/100P/100 or 0 with probability (100−P)/100(100−P)/100(100-P)/100 independently from all other values. Scoring The cost of asking a query about a submatrix with r2−r1+1=Ar2−r1+1=Ar_2-r_1+1 = A rows and c2−c1+1=Bc2−c1+1=Bc_2-c_1+1 = B columns is ⌈(2N−A)(2N−B)1+X⌉,⌈(2N−A)(2N−B)1+X⌉,leftlceil frac{(2N-A)(2N-B)}{1+X} rightrceil ,, where X denotes the number of infected people in this submatrix. The score of a test case is the sum of costs of all queries you make. The score of a test file is the sum of scores of all test cases. The score of a submission is the sum of scores of all test files. Your goal is to minimise the score of your submission. There are twenty test files. During the contest, the displayed score will account for exactly one test file of each type, i.e. your score reflects your submission's performance on 20% (4/20) of the test files. However, if your program gets a non-AC verdict on any test file, your submission's verdict will be non-AC. In other words, an AC verdict denotes that your program runs successfully on all the test files. After the end of the contest, your score will be changed to include the sum of your program's scores over the other 16 test files.

The game continues until there is a row, column, or diagonal containing three of the same symbol (X or O), and the player with that token is declared the winner. Otherwise if every cell of the grid contains a symbol and nobody won, then the game ends and it is considered a draw. You are given a tic-tac-toe board A after a certain number of moves, consisting of symbols O, X, and underscore(___). Underscore signifies an empty cell. Print 1: if the position is reachable, and the game has drawn or one of the players won. 2: if the position is reachable, and the game will continue for at least one more move. 3: if the position is not reachable. Note: Starting from an empty board, reachable position means that the grid is possible after a finite number of moves in the game where the players may or may not be playing optimally. The answer for each testcase should be with respect to the present position and independent of the results in the further successive moves.

There are N soldiers in the kingdom, numbered 1 through N and standing in a circle in such a way that for each valid i, the soldier directly to the right of the i-th soldier is soldier i+1i+1i+1, and the soldier directly to the right of the N-th soldier is soldier 1. Each soldier holds a sword and a shield. The sword is used to attack other soldiers and the shield is used to defend from attacks. Let's denote the attack value of the i-th soldier's sword by aiaia_i and the defense value of the i-th soldier's shield by didid_i. In the battle, each soldier picks one of the soldiers standing to his left and right, and attacks that soldier. The choices of the soldiers are completely independent, so each soldier can be attacked by the soldier to his left, by the soldier to his right (the power of such an attack is the attack value of the attacking soldier's sword), by both of them (then, the power of the resulting attack is the sum of the attack values of these soldiers' swords) or by nobody. A soldier remains alive if the defense value of his shield is strictly greater than the power with which he is attacked. Everyone attacks simultaneously and there is only one round of attacks. Each soldier that remains alive at the end is awarded a laurel. The king of Airland likes these fights, so the host of the battle promised the king that he can pick one soldier and if the soldier he picks survives the battle, the king receives the shield of that soldier. Chef is the deputy of the king and you want to help him pick a soldier for the king in such a way that the king receives the best shield (with the greatest defense value). However, if Chef picks a soldier and that soldier does not survive, Chef will be thrown in a snake pit.

Each participant should be a member of exactly one group. Sum up the scores of participants in each individual group.

Chef wants to choose the groups in such a way that the total score is maximum possible. Since there may be many ways to form the groups that lead to the maximum total score, Chef wants to know just the size of the largest group and the size of the smallest group which could be formed while still maximising the total score.

Over a series of days, Chef wants to read each page. On each day, Chef can choose to read any set of pages such that there is no prime that divides the numbers of two or more of these pages, i.e. the numbers of pages he reads on the same day must be pairwise coprime. For example, Chef can read pages 1, 3 and 101010 on one day, since (1,3)(1,3)(1, 3), (3,10)(3,10)(3, 10) and (1,10)(1,10)(1, 10) are pairs of coprime integers; however, he cannot read pages 1, 3 and 6 on one day, as 3 and 6 are both divisible by 3. Since chef might get bored by reading the same recipe again and again, Chef will read every page exactly once.

Array Rotation ,"Given an array A of length N, we can define rotation as follows. If we rotate A to the right, all elements move to the right one unit, and the last element moves to the beginning. That is, it becomes [AN,A1,A2,…,AN−1][AN,A1,A2,…,AN−1][A_N, A_1,A_2,ldots,A_{N-1}]. Similarly if we rotate A to the left, it becomes [A2,A3,…,AN,A1][A2,A3,…,AN,A1][A_2,A_3,ldots,A_N, A_1]. Given an array A and an integer x, define f(A,x)f(A,x)f(A,x) to be the array A rotated by the amount x. If x≥0x≥0xge 0, this means we rotate it right x times. If x<0x<0x<0, this means we rotate it left |x||x||x| times. You are given an array A of length N. Then Q queries follow. In each query, an integer x is given. To answer the query, you should replace A with A+f(A,x)A+f(A,x)A+f(A,x) where + denotes concatenation. After this operation, you must output the sum of all elements of A. Since this number can be large, output it modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7. Note that the queries are cumulative. When you modify A to answer one query, it starts that way for the next query.

The trains are represented by an array A, where Ai=0Ai=0A_i = 0 means the i-th city doesn't have any train originating from it, Ai=1Ai=1A_i = 1 means the train originating from the i-th city is moving right (to a higher numbered city), and Ai=2Ai=2A_i = 2 means the train originating from the i-th city is moving left (to a lower numbered city). Each train keeps on going forever in its direction and takes 1 minute to travel from the current station to the next one.

Chef and Magical Jars ,"Chef decided to teach some advanced recipes to junior chefs. On the very first day of their cooking sessions, to identify the cooking abilities of each junior chef, Chef instructed them to make their premier dishes. The junior chefs were very excited and they all went into the kitchen to cook their dishes. Chef has a limited number of jars in the kitchen. The jars are magical ― if a chef that is cooking a dish requiring x ingredients takes x jars, each of these jars fills itself with one of the required ingredients, and after this chef finishes cooking and returns the jars to the kitchen, they empty themselves (and are ready for other chefs to take some or all of them). Of course, this means it is impossible to cook a dish requiring x ingredients with less than x jars. Since Chef did not tell the junior chefs in which order they should prepare their dishes, they started picking up jars simultaneously and in the end, no junior chef was able to acquire enough jars to prepare their premier dish. Also, none of the junior chefs are willing to lend their jars to others. Chef was unable to handle the situation and decided to call off the cooking session for that day, so that he could get more jars and try it again later. You know that there are N junior chefs (numbered 1 through N) and for each valid i, the number of ingredients required for the dish of the i-th chef is AiAiA_i. If there are J jars, then formally, the following process happens: The junior chefs take some jars; let's denote the number of jars taken by the i-th chef by aiaia_i. Any distribution of jars such that 0≤ai0≤ai0 le a_i for each valid i and ∑Ni=1ai=J∑i=1Nai=Jsum_{i=1}^N a_i = J is possible. At any time, if ai<Aiai<Aia_i lt A_i for each chef i that has not prepared their dish yet, the cooking session is a failure. Otherwise, one of the chefs who have at least as many jars as the number of required ingredients prepares their dish and returns their jars to the kitchen. Whenever some jars are returned to the kitchen, they are immediately taken by some chefs that have not prepared their dishes yet (possibly all the jars by one chef). This process continues with chefs taking jars, cooking their dishes and returning jars, until no chef can cook their dish anymore or all chefs have cooked their dishes. When all junior chefs have successfully cooked their dishes, the cooking session ends successfully. Chef wants to know the minimum number of magical jars that should be present in the kitchen initially so that the session would be successful regardless of how the junior chefs pick up the jars. Chef is a legendary cook, but he is not very good at mathematics, so he asks you to find that number. Tags: Observation Algorithms ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/MAGICJAR,CC
Attendance ,"Chef is teaching a cooking course. There are N students attending the course, numbered 1 through N. Before each lesson, Chef has to take attendance, i.e. call out the names of students one by one and mark which students are present. Each student has a first name and a last name. In order to save time, Chef wants to call out only the first names of students. However, whenever there are multiple students with the same first name, Chef has to call out the full names (both first and last names) of all these students. For each student that does not share the first name with any other student, Chef may still call out only this student's first name. Help Chef decide, for each student, whether he will call out this student's full name or only the first name.

To maintain balance and to ensure that there is no unnecessary load due to torque, it's important that the weights added to the left side are symmetric to the weights added to the right side. It is not required to use all of the weights. It is also not required to use any weights at all, if Chef feels satisfied lifting only the rod. For example: 1 2 2 1 |Rod Center| 1 1 1 3 is a wrong configuration, but 1 2 3 1 |Rod Center| 1 3 2 1 is a right configuration.

We can see that whichever truth or dare tasks Shyam asks Ram to perform, Ram can easily perform them, so he wins. However, if Shyam can give him dare tasks 3 and 100100100, then Ram will not be able to perform dare task 3, so Shyam wins.

Currently, he is learning how to make the deck sorted in non-decreasing order (from top to bottom) of the numbers on the cards using at most one shuffle move. A shuffle move means taking an arbitrary number of cards from the top of the deck and putting them at the bottom of the deck in the same relative order. For example, if we have a deck of cards with numbers (5,7,3,3,8,2)(5,7,3,3,8,2)(5, 7, 3, 3, 8, 2), it is allowed to take the top three cards (5,7,3)(5,7,3)(5, 7, 3) and put them at the bottom; the result is (3,8,2,5,7,3)(3,8,2,5,7,3)(3, 8, 2, 5, 7, 3).

Note that these Li,jLi,jL_{i,j} include the duration of the beginning intro song in each episode. The streaming service that he uses, allows Chef to skip the intro song. The intro song changes slightly each season, and so he wants to watch the intro song in the first episode of each season, but he'll skip it in all other episodes of that season (yes, we know, a sacrilege!). You know that the intro song lasts for QiQiQ_i minutes in the ithithi^{th} season. Find the total time in minutes, that he has to watch.

Chef and Ridges ,"We have a rectangular piece of cardboard with width 1 (its height is not important). We are going to fold it in the following way: pick up the right side of the piece of cardboard and move it to the left until it touches the left side this way, a smaller piece of cardboard with width 1/21/21/2 is created; if we unfolded it, we could see a vertical ridge formed in the middle pick up the left side of this new piece of cardboard and move it to the right until it touches the (new) right side pick up the right side of the resulting piece of cardboard and move it to the left until it touches the left side, etc. Whenever the cardboard is folded, exactly one of its new sides is a newly formed ridge (there may be more, internal ridges formed, but we do not consider these). Let's denote such a ridge created in the k-th folding by RkRkR_k. In total, we fold the piece of cardboard N times. Afterwards, we unfold it and look at the formed ridges. Let's denote the distance of ridge RNRNR_N (i.e. the last formed outer ridge) from the left side of the original piece of cardboard by DNDND_N. For example, D1=1/2D1=1/2D_1 = 1/2 and D2=1/4D2=1/4D_2 = 1/4. It is possible to express DNDND_N as an irreducible fraction x/yx/yx/y. Find this fraction.

Your task is to find these coordinates. You may ask Chef at most QQ queries (providing your answer does not count as a query).

Then, you should read a line containing a single integer. If this integer is non-negative, it denotes the answer to your query. Otherwise, it means that you exceeded the limit on the number of queries, the coordinates you printed are invalid or some other error occured. When you have found the secret rectangle, you should print a line containing the character 'A', a space and four space-separated integers xlx_l, yly_l, xux_u and yuy_u. Then, you should read a single line containing one integer, which is 11 if your answer was correct or negative if it was wrong. Note that when you read a negative integer, you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict.

Ready Bitwise ,"Yukti found a strange paper with a Boolean expression written on it. Unfortunately, all the operands were missing from this expression. Being an innovative person, Yukti immediately created a riddle for her students based on this incomplete expression. The students are given a string L describing a valid Boolean expression, where each operand (value) is replaced by the character '#'. A valid expression is defined as one of the following: A single term '#'. A string in the format ""([expression1][operator][expression2])"", where [expression1] and [expression2] are valid expressions and [operator] is one of the characters '&', '|' and '^' (denoting bitwise AND, OR and XOR respectively). Each of the characters '#' in the string L should be replaced by one of the characters '0', '1', 'a' and 'A', uniformly randomly and independently. Then, the resulting expression is evaluated as follows: A Boolean value a (0 or 1) is chosen. Each occurrence of the character 'a' is interpreted as this value and each occurrence of 'A' is interpreted as its negation (1−a1−a1-a). The characters '0' and '1' are interpreted as the Boolean values 0 and 1 respectively. Since there are two possible values of a, we obtain two constant Boolean expressions this way. Let's denote them by G0G0G_0 (when a = 0) and G1G1G_1 (when a = 1). Let's evaluate G0G0G_0 and G1G1G_1. If G0=G1=0G0=G1=0G_0 = G_1 = 0, the value of the expression is '0'. If G0=G1=1G0=G1=1G_0 = G_1 = 1, the value of the expression is '1'. If G0=0G0=0G_0 = 0 and G1=1G1=1G_1 = 1, the value of the expression is 'a'. If G0=1G0=1G_0 = 1 and G1=0G1=0G_1 = 0, the value of the expression is 'A'. Can you find the probabilities with which the expression obtained after substituting for each character '#' evaluates to these values? It can be proved that for each of these values, the probability can be expressed as a fraction PQPQfrac{P}{Q}, where P and Q are integers (P≥0P≥0P ge 0, Q>0Q>0Q gt 0) and Q is coprime with 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353. You should compute P⋅Q−1P⋅Q−1P cdot Q^{-1} modulo 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353 for each of these values.

Gold Mining ,"Chef and Chefu are working as gold miners. There are a total of N gold mines, numbered 1 through N. For each valid i, the i-th gold mine contains GiGiG_i gold in total; if only Chef worked in it, it would take him AiAiA_i days to completely mine it, while if only Chefu worked in it, it would take him BiBiB_i days. Each of our miners may only work in one mine at a time, but they may decide to start working in another mine at any time (even in the middle of some day), any number of times. They also choose the mines to work in independently from each other and they may work in the same mine at the same time. Mining gold is a continuous process, i.e. if a miner works for t days (where t is a real number) in a mine where this miner has mining speed g gold per day, then he will mine g⋅tg⋅tg cdot t gold. Obviously, it is impossible to work in a mine after no gold remains in it. For example, if a gold mine contains 303030 gold and Chef needs 2 days to completely mine it, but he spends 1 day in it, then he will mine 151515 gold; if Chefu needs 1 day to completely mine the same gold mine, and both Chef and Chefu start working in this mine at the same time, it will be empty after 2/32/32/3 days ― Chefu will mine 202020 gold, while Chef will mine 101010 gold. At each point of time, both Chef and Chefu know the gold mine in which the other miner is working. Each of them wants to gather the maximum amount of gold for himself. Find the amounts of gold the miners will have if they both act optimally. Tags: Basic Maths, ad-hoc Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/GOLMINE,CC
Guess It Right ,"Chef is playing a game against a magician. In this game, there are initially N identical boxes in front of Chef and one of them contains a magic pill ― after eating this pill, you would never get compilation errors ever again. Chef has to determine which box contains the pill. He is allowed to perform at most M moves. In each move, Chef may do one of the following: Choose one of the boxes that are in front of him uniformly randomly and guess that this box contains the pill. If the guess is correct, the game ends and Chef gets the pill. Otherwise, after this guess, the magician adds K empty boxes in front of Chef in such a way that Chef cannot determine which boxes were added; the box Chef guessed also remains in front of him and Chef cannot distinguish this box from the other boxes in subsequent moves either. Choose a number X such that X is a positive multiple of K, but strictly less than the current number of boxes in front of Chef. The magician then removes X empty boxes. Of course, Chef must not perform this move if the current number of boxes is ≤K≤Kle K. What is the probability that Chef gets the pill, assuming that he plays optimally ― in a way that maximises this probability? It can be proven that the maximum probability may be expressed as a fraction P/QP/QP/Q, where P and Q are coprime positive integers. You should compute P⋅Q−1P⋅Q−1P cdot Q^{-1} modulo 109+7109+710^9+7, where Q−1Q−1Q^{-1} denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 109+7109+710^9+7.

Yet Another Problem About Sequences ,"For a set of positive integers S, let's define gcd(S)gcd(S)mathrm{gcd}(S) as the greatest integer which divides each element of S. If gcd(S)=1gcd(S)=1mathrm{gcd}(S) = 1, the set S is called coprime. For example, the set {7,12,15}{7,12,15}{7, 12, 15} is coprime, but {6,12,15}{6,12,15}{6, 12, 15} is not coprime, since every element of this set is divisible by 3. Your task is to find an integer sequence A0,A1,…,AN−1A0,A1,…,AN−1A_0, A_1, ldots, A_{N-1} such that: for each valid i, 1≤Ai≤1091≤Ai≤1091 le A_i le 10^9 A0,A1,…,AN−1A0,A1,…,AN−1A_0, A_1, ldots, A_{N-1} are pairwise distinct for each valid i, the set {Ai,A(i+1)%N}{Ai,A(i+1)%N}{A_i, A_{(i+1)%N}} is not coprime (%%% denotes the modulo operator) for each valid i, the set {Ai,A(i+1)%N,A(i+2)%N}{Ai,A(i+1)%N,A(i+2)%N}{A_i, A_{(i+1)%N}, A_{(i+2)%N}} is coprime It is possible that there is no solution.

Chef and War with Taran (Challenge) ,"Technology has advanced so much that it is now common for everyone to have robots do their work. Codechef is still the popular choice of competitive programming platform, the reason being great quality of problems. One fine day, Taran decided to gain access to all problems by beating Master Chef of Codechef in a robot war. There are N types of robots numbered 1 through N with an infinite supply for each type. If two robots of different types fight, one of them wins and the other loses; you are given a matrix M with size N×NN×NNtimes N, where for each valid i,ji,ji, j, a robot of type i wins against a robot of type j if Mij=1Mij=1M_{ij} = 1. If two robots of the same type fight, the result is a draw. Chef will buy N robots in total and Taran will also buy N robots in total. Both Taran and Chef can buy any number of robots of each type, including zero. Taran cleverly decided to buy his robots only after knowing the N robots bought by Chef, so that his chances of winning are maximized. After buying the robots, the war begins. It happens in N turns; two robots fight in each turn, one of them is Chef's and the other is Taran's. For the first A turns, Chef chooses his robot as well as Taran's robot which will fight in the current turn. For the next B turns, Taran chooses his robot as well as Chef’s robot that will fight against each other. At the end of a turn, both robots are completely destroyed and can't be used again. Since Master Chef trusts his talented programmers, you were asked to fight against Taran to save their problems for future contests. Your goal is to maximize the number of turns when your robot won a fight. P.S.: After seeing this problem, Taran decided to befriend Master Chef instead. The problems are safe now.

Mixi Game ,"Vanja and Miksi have already finished everything for this year at their university, so they decided to spend their free time playing a game with a binary sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,ANA_1, A_2, dots, A_N (i.e. a sequence containing only integers 0 and 1). At the beginning of the game, Vanja and Miksi write down the expression ∗A1∗A2∗A3∗…∗AN∗A1∗A2∗A3∗…∗AN* A_1 * A_2 * A_3 * ldots * A_N (note below that each ∗∗* is a placeholder and does not denote multiplication). The players take turns alternately, starting with Vanja. The game lasts N turns. In each turn, the current player must replace the first (leftmost) remaining ∗∗* by the sign + or −−- (or, equivalently, by the operation of addition or subtraction). After the last turn, the boys calculate the resulting value V of the expression. If |V|≥K|V|≥K|V| ge K, the winner is Vanja; otherwise, the winner is Miksi.

Birthday Gift Again ,"All strings in Chefland are beautiful because they are binary strings (a binary string contains only characters '0' and '1'). The beauty of a binary string S is defined as the number of pairs (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) (1≤i≤j≤|S|1≤i≤j≤|S|1 le i le j le |S|) such that the substring Si,Si+1,…,SjSi,Si+1,…,SjS_i, S_{i+1}, ldots, S_j is special. For a binary string U, let's denote the number of occurrences of the characters '1' and '0' in U by cnt1cnt1cnt_1 and cnt0cnt0cnt_0 respectively; then, U is special if cnt0=cnt1⋅cnt1cnt0=cnt1⋅cnt1cnt_0 = cnt_1 cdot cnt_1. Today, Chef's friend Araspa is celebrating her birthday. Chef wants to give Araspa the most beautiful binary string he can find.

Beautiful Garland ,"There is a garland — a cyclic rope with red and green flowers on it in some order. The sequence of flower colours is described by a string s; since the rope is cyclic, each two consecutive flowers are adjacent and the first and last flower are also adjacent. The garland is beautiful if there is no pair of adjacent flowers with identical colours. You want the garland to be beautiful. To achieve that, you may perform the following operation at most once: Make two cuts on the rope (not intersecting the flowers), splitting the garland into two parts. Reverse one of these two parts. Tie together corresponding endpoints of the two parts, creating one whole garland again. Can you find out whether it is possible to make the garland beautiful?

A Pizza Slice ,"ChefX showed ChefY his new pizza slice design. The design is a planar figure that can be drawn in the following way: Draw a point A0A0mathsf{A}_0 and two rays from this point such that the angle between them is α<π/2α<π/2alpha lt pi/2. Mark N points A1,A2,A3,…,ANA1,A2,A3,…,ANmathsf{A}_1, mathsf{A}_2, mathsf{A}_3, ldots, mathsf{A}_N on one ray in this order (A1A1mathsf{A}_1 is closest to A0A0mathsf{A}_0). Mark N points B1,B2,B3,…,BNB1,B2,B3,…,BNmathsf{B}_1, mathsf{B}_2, mathsf{B}_3, ldots, mathsf{B}_N on the other ray in this order (B1B1mathsf{B}_1 is closest to A0A0mathsf{A}_0).

Moving Rectangles (Challenge) ,"In order to solidify their friendship, Taran sent Birju another challenge problem and asked him to find the best solution. Birju is good at writing stories as well as solving problems, but he is unable to solve this problem. Birju is worried that if he does not solve the problem, Taran might forget their friendship and unleash another war, deadlier than the last one. Therefore, he is asking you for help with this problem. This is an interactive problem. There are N rectangles (numbered 1 through N) in a plane described by Cartesian coordinates x and y. Initially (at time 0), each rectangle is moving parallel to one of the coordinate axes with fixed speed 1 unit per second. You are given the width, height and position of each rectangle, as well as the direction in which it is initially moving. You must repeat the following process N times: Read a string S given by the grader. This string is either ""REVERSE"" or ""ROTATE"" and describes the operation you should perform on one rectangle. These operations are applied in chronological order, i.e. the current operation is applied after all the previous operations have already been applied. Choose one rectangle on which this operation should be applied. Let's denote the number of this rectangle by r. Choose the second s (between 1 and N inclusive) during which this operation should be applied. If an operation is applied during the s-th second, it means that is applied strictly between time s−1s−1s-1 and time s. Since the operations must be performed in chronological order, you may only choose the s-th second if all previous operations have been applied during the 1-st through s-th second (inclusive). If S is ""REVERSE"", then during the s-th second, the direction in which the r-th rectangle is currently moving is reversed — it is changed from North to South, from South to North, from West to East or from East to West. If S is ""ROTATE"", then during the s-th second, the direction in which the r-th rectangle is currently moving is rotated by 90∘90∘90^circ. You must choose the new direction dirdirdir for this rectangle's velocity. From North to South, you may change the direction to East or West (but not to North or South), and vice versa. The rectangles are moving in discrete steps — at the end of each second (after all the operations applied during this second are performed), each rectangle moves by 1 unit in its currently assigned direction. The rectangles do not move at time 0, but they move at time N. Let's assign numbers and coordinates to directions in the following way: moving by 1 unit in direction 0 (North): the y-coordinate increases by 1 moving by 1 unit in direction 1 (East): the x-coordinate increases by 1 moving by 1 unit in direction 2 (South): the y-coordinate decreases by 1 moving by 1 unit in direction 3 (West): the x-coordinate decreases by 1 After N seconds (immediately after the rectangles moved at time N), consider the sum of common areas of each unordered pair of different rectangles, i.e. A=∑Ni=1∑Nj=i+1area(i,j)A=∑i=1N∑j=i+1Narea(i,j)A = sum_{i=1}^N sum_{j=i+1}^N mathrm{area}(i, j) where area(x,y)area(x,y)mathrm{area}(x, y) denotes the common area, i.e. area of the intersection of rectangles x and y. Can we maximise A if we apply the operations optimally? Good luck! Interaction First, your program should read a line containing a single integer ― the number of test cases T. The description of interaction for T test cases follows. For each test case, you must start by reading a line containing a single integer N. Then, you must read N lines. For each i (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N1 le i le N), the i-th of these lines contain five space-separated integers vxvxv_x, vyvyv_y, dxdxd_x, dydyd_y and dirdirdir describing a rectangle with width dxdxd_x and height dydyd_y moving in direction dirdirdir. The initial coordinates of this rectangle's vertices are (vx,vy)(vx,vy)(v_x, v_y), (vx+dx,vy)(vx+dx,vy)(v_x+d_x, v_y), (vx,vy+dy)(vx,vy+dy)(v_x, v_y+d_y) and (vx+dx,vy+dy)(vx+dx,vy+dy)(v_x+d_x, v_y+d_y). Then, you must perform the following process N times: Read a line containing a single string S. If S is ""REVERSE"", print a single line containing two space-separated integers r and s denoting that the current operation should be applied on the r-th rectangle during the s-th second. If S is ""ROTATE"", print a single line containing three space-separated integers r, dirdirdir and s denoting that the current operation should be applied on the r-th rectangle during the s-th second and the new direction of its velocity becomes dirdirdir. Your output must satisfy the following conditions: 1≤r,s≤N1≤r,s≤N1 le r, s le N 0≤dir≤30≤dir≤30 le dir le 3 Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line! Otherwise, the grader will wait for your response forever and the verdict of your submission may be anything except Accepted (which you might not like). Test generation In each test file, T=3T=3T = 3; also, integers N and MXMXMX are chosen manually. Then, for each rectangle: vxvxv_x and vyvyv_y are generated uniformly randomly between 0 and 10410410^4 inclusive dxdxd_x and dydyd_y are generated uniformly randomly between 1 and MXMXMX inclusive dirdirdir is generated uniformly randomly between 0 and 3 inclusive S is generated uniformly randomly from the set {""ROTATE"", ""REVERSE""} There are three types of tests: type 1: five test files with N=500N=500N = 500 and MX=10MX=10MX = 10 type 2: five test files with N=10N=10N = 10 and MX=100MX=100MX = 100 type 3: ten test files with N=10N=10N = 10 and MX=10MX=10MX = 10 Scoring The score of each test case is computed as A⋅105/(N2MX2)A⋅105/(N2MX2)A cdot 10^5 / (N^2 MX^2). The score of each test file is the sum of scores of all test cases in that file. The score of a submission is the sum of scores of all test files. There are twenty test files. During the contest, the displayed score will account for exactly four test files, i.e. your score reflects your submission's performance on 20% (4 out of 20) of the test files. However, if your program gets a non-AC verdict on any test file, your submission's verdict will be non-AC. In other words, an AC verdict denotes that your program runs successfully on all the test files. After the end of the contest, your score will be changed to the sum of your program's scores over the other sixteen test files.

Under the Tunnels ,"""All the pain in the world will not help you find something that does not exist…"" You are Dastan, the great Prince of Persia! Under the tunnels of Alamut, you have discovered a path ― a sequence of N tiles (numbered 1 through N) ahead of you. You are currently on tile 1. There is a signboard beside you, which says thus: Stepping on tile i (for each valid i) activates a switch described by a binary string SiSiS_i with length N. When you fell through the tunnels onto tile 1, switch S1S1S_1 got activated. For each valid i, when the switch SiSiS_i gets activated, then for each j (1≤j≤N)1≤j≤N)1 le j le N), if the j-th character of SiSiS_i is '0', tile j becomes unsafe to step on; otherwise (if the j-th character is '1'), tile j becomes safe to step on. Step on an unsafe tile and you shall testify the fate of all men ― death! You shall find that which you seek on reaching tile N. This tile must also be safe when you step on it. Being a trained warrior, you are able to make jumps with length up to K tiles, in both directions. In other words, if you are currently at a tile i, you may jump to a tile j if j is a valid tile and |i−j|≤K|i−j|≤K|i-j| le K.

Chef and Two Queens ,"Chef got in the trouble! He is the king of Chefland and Chessland. There is one queen in Chefland and one queen in Chessland and they both want a relationship with him. Chef is standing before a difficult choice… Chessland may be considered a chessboard with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M). Let's denote a unit square in row r and column c by (r,c)(r,c)(r, c). Chef lives at square (X,Y)(X,Y)(X, Y) of this chessboard. Currently, both queens are living in Chessland too. Each queen, when alone on the chessboard, can see all squares that lie on the same row, column or diagonal as itself. A queen from (xq,yq)(xq,yq)(x_q, y_q) cannot see a square (r,c)(r,c)(r, c) if the square (X,Y)(X,Y)(X, Y) is strictly between them. Of course, if the queens can see each other, the kingdom will soon be in chaos! Help Chef calculate the number of possible configurations of the queens such that the kingdom will not be in chaos. A configuration is an unordered pair of distinct squares (xq1,yq1)(xq1,yq1)(x_{q1}, y_{q1}) and (xq2,yq2)(xq2,yq2)(x_{q2}, y_{q2}) such that neither of them is the square (X,Y)(X,Y)(X, Y).

Maximize LCM ,"Chef is becoming bored with the recent lockdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak. To pass some time, he has started learning cryptography. He is very excited to see different types of keys used in cryptography and decided to invent a new type of a key. First, Chef made a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,ANA_1, A_2, ldots, A_N, which lie between 1 and M inclusive. After a lot of sleepless nights, he has decided that his key will be the LCM of this sequence, but he is not satisfied ― he wants to make his key as large as possible. In order to do that, he wants to append exactly one more integer to the sequence. This integer must also lie between 1 and M inclusive. Help Chef maximise the key. Find the integer which Chef should append to the sequence in order to make the key (the LCM of elements of the resulting sequence) as large as possible.

Your goal is to divide the elements of S into two groups (multisets); each element of S must be in exactly one of these groups and the sum of elements of one group must be equal to the sum of elements of the other group. In our example, it is possible to make the groups {1,1,2,2,3}{1,1,2,2,3}{1, 1, 2, 2, 3} and {1,2,3,3}{1,2,3,3}{1, 2, 3, 3}; the sum of elements of each group is 9.

Pumping Water ,"In ChefLand, there is a mountain range consisting of N hills (numbered 1 through N) in a straight line. Let's denote the height of the i-th hill from the left by hihih_i. Ada is working on the water supply system of ChefLand. On some of the hills, she wants to place water reservoirs; then, for each reservoir, she will decide in which direction the water should flow from it — either to the left or to the right (water may not flow in both directions from the same reservoir). From a reservoir on a hill with height h, water flows in the chosen direction until it reaches the first hill that is strictly higher than h; all hills before this hill (including the hill containing the reservoir) are therefore supplied with water. For example, suppose we have hills with heights [7,2,3,5,8][7,2,3,5,8][7, 2, 3, 5, 8]. If we place a reservoir on the hill with height 5, and pump water from it to the left, then the hills with heights 2, 3 and 5 are supplied with water. Help Ada find the minimum numer of reservoirs needed to provide water to all the hills if she chooses the directions optimally.

Magician versus Chef 2 ,"The last time in Byteland, Chef defeated the magician in his challenge and won a gold coin. The magician does not want to give up his coin so easily, so he gives Chef N coins. One of them is real and the remaining N−1N−1N-1 are fake; all fake coins have equal weights, different from the weight of the real coin. The coins are otherwise indistinguishable. Chef has to find the real coin by himself. To make it fair, the magician gives Chef a balance. The balance is magical — it stays balanced when the sums of weights of coins put on each side are equal, but if they are not equal, the balance tilts to a random side instead of the side with the greater sum of weights. Chef can only use this balance up to K times; if he cannot uniquely determine which coin is the real one afterwards, he has to guess the real coin (he may make a guess in any way he wants). If Chef uses the balance optimally, what is the minimum possible probability that he will correctly determine the real coin at the end? We are interested in the worst-case scenario where the position of the gold coin is fixed initially (but unknown to Chef).

Maximize Letter Beauty ,"Chef's fans want to celebrate the special occasion of his birthday, so they are writing letters to him. Chef has received N such letters from N fans (numbered 1 through N). Initially, for each valid i, he assigned a beauty BiBiB_i to the letter from the i-th fan (these values may even be negative, for letters that are not written well). Now, Chef wants you to process Q queries on these letters. There are two types of queries: Q x y: Chef wants to choose integers l and r such that 1≤l≤x≤y≤r≤N1≤l≤x≤y≤r≤N1 le l le x le y le r le N and read all the letters from fans l,l+1,…,rl,l+1,…,rl, l+1, ldots, r.

How to Repaint a Fence ,"John's barn has a fence consisting of N consecutive parts numbered from left to right starting from 1 to N. Each part is initially painted in one of two colors: red or green, whose information is provided you by a string C. The color of i-th part Ci will be equal to 'R' if the color of the part is red and 'G' if it is green. John decided to paint the whole fence in green color. To make the mundane process of painting more entertaining he decided to do it using the following process. Every minute (until the whole fence is painted green) he will do the following steps: Choose any part of the fence that is painted red. Let's denote the index of this part as X. For each part with indices X, X+1, ., min(N, X + K - 1), flip the color of the corresponding part from red to green and from green to red by repainting.

So his friend Lotsy decided to buy N cakes, because a friend's birthday must be the best day of his life! A cake can be thought of as a 4 × 4 square matrix, and in each cell of the matrix no more than 1 candle can be placed. The two boys like to play a game, in which they extinguish candles. They play in turns, with the birthday boy Pishty taking the first turn. In each turn, one of the boys picks a cake with burning candles on it, chooses a rectangle (ie. a submatrix ) which has burning candles in all its cells, and extinguishes all those candles. If a boy can't make a move, he loses. You should assume that they play optimally. No one likes to lose a game, even to their best friend!

Earthquake ,"in Bytetown! Situation is getting out of control! All buildings in Bytetown stand on straight line. The buildings are numbered 0, 1, ., N−1 from left to right. Every hour one shake occurs. Each shake has 3 parameters: the leftmost building that was damaged during this shake, the corresponding rightmost building, and the force of the shake. Each time all the buildings in the disaster area are damaged equally. Let's consider this process in details. At any moment every building has the number that indicates its height (may have leading zeroes). This number corresponds to some string consisting of digits. When some shake affects to the building its string circularly rotates to the left by the value of the force of the shake and its height corresponds to the value of new string. Pay attention that after rotation string may have leading zeroes. For instance: a building with height 950 got in disaster area with force 2, Then its string become 095, so height in reality is 95. If it was one more shake with force 1, then its height would become 950 again. Major of Bytetown got some ideas how to protect residents, so sometimes he needs such kind of stats: find height of the highest building on some interval. You are given information about all the heights before the very first shake and then you get queries of two types: Type 0, described by 0 Li Ri Fi: Shake occurred on interval [Li, Ri] with force Fi. Type 1, described by 1 Li Ri: The major wants to know the biggest height on interval [Li, Ri]. Here, of course, the interval [L, R] contains all the building k such that L ≤ k ≤ R.

Merciless Chef ,"These days Chief Chef is becoming more and more merciless. His mind is becoming full of cruel intentions. Today he has decided to slowly poison and kill some of the staff members of his kitchen. Yeah, he is bored with them. There are N Chefs in the kitchen besides the Chief Chef. Every Chef in the kitchen has an index. The index of the Chief Chef is 0. Remaining N chefs have indices between 1 and N and no two chefs have the same index. As any other kitchen in the street, every chef has exactly one Immediate-Superior and can have any number of Superiors above him. A chef (say A) is Superior of another chef (say B) if either A is the Immediate-Superior of B or A is the Superior of Immediate-Superior of B. The Chief Chef is on the top position and Superior to all N chefs and has no Superior above him. If A is Immediate-Superior of B, then B is called Immediate-Inferior of A. If A is Superior of B then B is called Inferior of A (See the example for better explanation). Every chef makes exactly one dish daily. There is a small custom in the kitchen that every day each chef should taste the dishes made by all his superiors on that day. So if our Chief Chef swaps the dish made by Chef A with a poisonous one, every Inferior of A will taste this dish on that day and get poisoned. Every poisonous dish has some specific sickness value X and the health of every chef poisoned by it decreases by X on that day. As soon as the health of a chef drops to zero or less, he dies. When a chef dies in the kitchen, Chief Chef recruits a new chef to replace the dead chef, so the Immediate Superior and all the Immediate Inferiors of the dead chef will become the Immediate Superior and Immediate Inferiors of the new chef respectively. The newly recruited chefs are very healthy. In fact, you can assume that they have infinite health. Chef has made some poison recipes and has some queries for you. He asks you one query per day for Q continuous days. He has two types of queries: 1) He gives you two integers A and X which means that he wants to make the dish made by A poisonous on that day with a poison of sickness value X. 2) He gives you one integer A. In this type of query he wants to know how many chefs among the inferiors of A are old chefs, i.e, not newly recruited chefs. Remember that chef can also poison the dish made by himself, which will be tasted by all N chefs.

Your task is to count how many traffic light sets should be deployed. In particular, for each road you want to know how many traffic light sets will appear on that road. Let's formalize how a road in the city is defined. A road is a segment on the plane with endpoints in Xi,1, Yi,1 and Xi,2, Yi,2 for ith line. You are guaranteed that each line segment is either a vertical line or a horizontal line. An intersection is a point that belongs to two line segments: one horizontal and another vertical. We guarantee that no two vertical lines will share a point and no two horizontal lines share a point. You must put a set of lights at each intersection of a horizontal and a vertical line segment where the point of intersection is not an endpoint of both segments.

Adi and the Tree ,"Adi's town has the shape of an undirected tree (i.e. a connected acyclic graph) with N vertices numbered 1 through N. There is one house at each vertex. Initially, all houses have lights turned off. Over time, M events occur. In each event, there are two vertices a and b (a≠ba≠ba neq b) such that the states of the lights of the houses at vertices a and b get flipped, i.e. at each of these houses, lights are turned off if they were on and vice versa. The distance between two vertices in the tree is the number of edges on the simple path between them. Clearly, the number of houses where lights are on is always even. After each event, you should pair up the vertices where houses have lights turned on (each vertex should appear in exactly one pair). Let's define the cost of a gather-up as the minimum possible sum of distances between the vertices in each pair. For example, if there are only two houses with lights on, then the cost of a gather-up is the distance between their vertices. If there are no houses with lights on, the cost of a gather-up is zero. After each event, Adi would like to know the cost of a gather-up at that time. Find these costs!

Chefland Squads and the Army Chief ,"The Chefland Army has N soldiers, standing in a row and numbered 1 through N from left to right. Their heights from left to right are A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,ANA_1, A_2, ldots, A_N. A squad consists of one or more consecutive soldiers, i.e. soldiers L through R (inclusive) for some L and R such that 1≤L≤R≤N1≤L≤R≤N1 le L le R le N. The strength of a squad is defined in the following way: for each soldier in this squad, find the number of soldiers in the squad with strictly greater heights that are standing to the left of this soldier, and sum up these numbers. The Army Chief decided to write down the strengths of all possible squads, but soon, he realised that it is a heavy task. Therefore, he only wants to know the median of the strengths of all possible squads. Note: The median of a sequence is the value that is in the middle when the sequence is sorted. If the length of the sequence is even, there are two values in the middle and the median is the smaller of these values (or either when they are equal).

Recipe for Philosopher Stone ,"With the help of Sheska, Edward now has the research notes of Dr. Marcho. To prevent the secret of Philosopher stone falling into the wrong hands, Marcho has encoded the secret in the form of a list of triplets of numbers. Edward remembers that Dr. Marcho gave him a hint while he was leaving, ""Sometimes you should try transmutation rectangles instead of circles, maybe they are better for making philosopher stones"". Edward first thought that this was a joke, but he has understood the hint now. He interprets each triplet as the length, breadth, and color of a rectangle centered at the origin. Given below is his interpretation to decode the numbers. There are N colored rectangles numbered from 1 to N, with the i-th rectangle having length LiLiL_{i}, breadth BiBiB_{i} and color CiCiC_{i}. Each rectangle is centered at the origin. That is, if for any rectangle, we draw both diagonals, the diagonals shall intersect at the origin. For example, a rectangle having length 10 and breadth 2 would have its 4 corners as (5, 1), (5, -1), (-5, 1) and (-5, -1). The rectangles are placed one over the other. Specifically, the rectangles are placed in the order in which they appear in the input, overlapping the previous rectangles. The rectangle i is partially hidden by the rectangle j if j > i. That is, only the colour of the top rectangle is visible in the overlapping region. Edward believes that the ratio of the area of each color in the final figure is pointing to some ratio of ingredients for making the philosopher stone. Can you find out how many unit squares of each colour are visible in the final figure?

Ground Stations ,"ISRO has shot to global fame after Mangalyaan. They have decided to build hi-tech ground stations throughout the country which can be used either as a control station or as a launch station (but not as both simultaneously). A control station is one which has all controls to the rocket. A launch station is the site from where a rocket is launched. For a successful launch, ISRO has identified that they need 2 control stations and that these 2 control stations should be equidistant from the launch station. Initially there is only one ground station having index 0, where the headquarters of ISRO is located. Over a period of time, they plan to build more and more ground stations. They can perform two kinds of operations (for given V): Type 0: Build a new ground station and construct a one-way road from the ground station having index V to the newly built ground station. In other words, if the index of the newly built ground station is W, then a one way road V->W having length = 1 is constructed. The index of the new ground station will be the smallest positive integer which is not the index of any existing ground station. (Of course, this also helps them to keep track of the number of ground stations they have built so far.) Type 1: Given a ground station with index V, count how many unordered pairs (P, Q) of ground stations exist such that the ground stations P and Q are both reachable from V (paths from V to P and V to Q exist), and there exists a ground station R (need not be reachable from V), such that distance(P, R) = distance(Q, R), R ≠ P, R ≠ Q and P ≠ Q. Of course, ISRO wants to know this information beforehand since such pairs (P, Q) are possible candidates for control stations, and R is a possible candidate for the launch station. Adding more explanation ""Given a ground station with index V, count how many unordered pairs (P, Q) of ground stations exist such that the ground stations P and Q are both reachable from V (paths from V to P and V to Q exist), and there exists a ground station R (need not be reachable from V), such that distance(P,R) = distance(Q, R), R ≠ P, R ≠ Q and P ≠ Q."" As this says, there need not be path from R->P or P->R. How ever please use the following as definition of distance. Distance(X, Y) = Number of roads in the unique path from X to Y, if the given road network were bi-directional. Please note that, V->P and V->Q should still exist in directed road network.

Queries on tree again! ,"You are given a simple connected graph G with N vertices and N edges (a simple graph is an un-directed graph that has no loops and no more than one edge between any two different vertices). It is obvious that the graph G contains exactly one cycle and you can assume that the length of this cycle is odd (there are odd number of vertices in this cycle). The vertices are numbered from 1 to N. Each edge is assigned a corresponding integer weight. Your mission is to stimulate two types of queries : Update query represented by f u v: change the sign of all the weights of the edges on the shortest path (you can see the definition of shortest path in this problem later on) from vertex u to vertex v. Find query represented by ? u v: On the shortest path from vertex u to vertex v, find the (possibly empty) set of consecutive edges such that the sum of the weights is maximal. In other words, let's define the shortest path from u to v as a_1, a_2, ., a_k (where a_1 = u and a_k = v). You have to find a_i and a_j such that i <= j and the sum of the weights of the edges of the path a_i, a_(i + 1), ., a_j is as large as possible. You just have to find that sum. The shortest path between two vertices u and v is the path connecting them with the minimal number of vertices. In this problem, it is obvious that there is only one shortest path between any pair of vertices of G.

Tandem ,"The chef was recently studying about repeated occurrences of substrings in the strings. In particular, he was studying about a string s. He calls a string to be in tandem if it can be represented as concatenation of three equal strings, i.e. it can be represented as A where A is a non-empty string. For brevity, he calls such strings tandem strings. For example, ""ababab"" is a tandem string whereas ""abab"" is not. Now, Chef is studying tandem substrings of string s. He calls a tandem substring an interesting tandem if the character following the substring in string s (if it exists) is different than the first character of the substring. If the character following the tandem substring does not exist (i.e. the substring appears as a suffix of string s), it's also called interesting tandem. Chef calls all the tandem substrings which are not interesting tandem as boring tandems. Now, chef wants your help in counting number of interesting and boring tandem substrings in string s. Please help him!! For example, let s be ""ababababb"". The substring s[3..14] = ""ababab"" is an interesting tandem, as the substring is a tandem and the character following the substring (i.e. s[15] = 'b') is different than the first character of the substring (i.e. 'a'). The substring s[1..12] = ""abababaa"" is a boring tandem, as the character following the tandem substring (i.e. s[13] = 'a') is same as the first character of the substring (i.e. 'a'). The substring s[15..17] = ""b"" is also an interesting tandem as the character following the tandem does not exist (i.e. this tandem substring appears as a suffix of string s). In summary, s[1..12], s[2..13], s[3..14], s[3..5], s[7..9], s[11..13], s[14..16], s[15..17] are all tandem substrings. Out of which, s[3..14], s[3..5], s[7..9], s[11..13], s[15..17] are all interesting tandems. Rest tandem substrings, s[1..12], s[2..13], s[14..16] are all boring tandems.

Kali and Devtas ,"The apocalyptic demon Kali is on a rampage. The ground shudders under his feet, trees shrivel and animals and birds scurry away from his path. In order to save the universe from devastation, all the devtas led by devraj Indra decide to meditate to please Lord Vishnu so that he appears in the form of Kalki, his last avatar, and kill the demon. Each devta can sit in meditation at a particular place on Swarglok (the heaven). Considering Swarglok as a 2-dimensional plane, the position of each devta is a fixed point with integer coordinates. The positions of all the devtas are distinct from each other. While meditating the devtas connect to each other by means of astral projections - metaphysical threads that connect one devta to another. They must do so in such a way to satisfy two criteria: Each devta must be able to connect to every other devta by following a path of astral projections. No subgroup of devtas may be connected by a cycle of astral projections. In simple terms, the astral projections must form a tree connecting all devtas. What needs to be optimized ? Once the devtas have taken their positions and are connected as a single group to start meditation, a ring of influence is formed around each devta. This ring is centered at the position of the devta, and has a radius equal to the Euclidean distance from this devta to the furthest devta directly connected via an astral projection. Since different devtas have their own supernatural powers (Indra is the rain god, Agni is the fire god,Varuna is the water god, Vayu is the air god , etc), the influence ring of each devta has an adverse effect on all other devtas which lie within or on this ring. In other words, the efficiency of a devta to perform meditation decreases as the number of influence rings that include him increases. For each devta Di, define Ci as the number of influence rings that include or touch Di (including their own). Now devraj Indra wants the devtas to connect in such a manner so as to minimize the maximum value of Ci over all devtas. So he has sent a message to Bhulok (the earth) and he needs help from the best programmers on the planet.

Snakes and transition from Capitalism to Socialism ,"After a long duration of the painful, torturous and tumultuous periods of capitalism in Snakeland, now the snakes have decided to adopt socialism. The houses in Snakeland are arranged in a rectangular fashion of dimension n * m. The wealth of the snake in the house at cell (i, j) is given by a[i][j] rupees. A bill has been passed for making a smooth transition from capitalism to socialism. At the end of each hour, the wealth of a snake will grow and will become equal to the highest wealth that its neighbor had (at the start of the hour). That is, consider the maximum wealth among its neighbors at the start of the hour, and this snake's wealth will become equal to that at the end of the hour. Note that this increase in wealth will happen simultaneously for each snake. Two houses are said to be neighbors of each other if they share a side or corner with each other. Find out the minimum number of hours required for this transition.

Maximum Size ,"Chef is playing an easier variation of the board game ‘Risk’ with his friend Mike. There is an N∗MN * M grid, depicting the world map. Each cell of the grid is either 11 or 00 where 11 denotes that there is land on this cell, while 00 denotes water. In a turn, a player can capture an uncaptured cell that has land, and keep capturing neighbouring cells that share a side with it if they are on land. A cell once captured by a player can't be captured again by another player. The game continues till no uncaptured cell has land. Each player wants to be in control of as many cells of land as possible in total when the game finishes. Find the maximum number of cells of land that Chef can capture if he plays second, and both players play optimally.

Even Edges ,"Chef has a simple undirected graph with N vertices (numbered 1 through N) and M edges. He wants to divide it into K parts (subgraphs) for some integer K. First, Chef divides the vertices in the graph into K sets such that each vertex belongs to exactly one set; the subgraphs and sets are numbered 1 through K such that for each valid i, vertices from the i-th set belong to the i-th subgraph. Then, Chef checks all the edges in the graph. For an edge connecting vertices u and v, if u and v are both in the i-th set, then this edge belongs to the i-th subgraph. Otherwise, this edge does not belong to any of these K subgraphs. At the end, Chef checks these K subgraphs. If each subgraph contains an even number of edges, then Chef thinks that this way of dividing the graph is delicious. Chef wants to divide the graph in a delicious way such that K is the smallest possible. Find the minimum K and one such way to divide the graph.

Bear and Clique Distances ,"Bearland consists of N cities, numbered 1 through N. Cities are connected with bidirectional roads. Cities 1 through K were built a long time ago, when citizens liked order and regularity. Each pair of those old cities is connected with a road of length X. Note that this description generates K*(K-1)/2 roads. There are M newer roads, not necessarily of the same lengths. The i-th of them connects cities ai and bi and has length ci. There is no road that connects a city to itself. All M+K*(K-1)/2 roads are distinct (ie. no two of them connects the same pair of cities).

Kingdom Unity ,"The Kingdom of Bytelandia has N cities, numbered from 0 to N−1. There are M bidirectional roads, each of which connects two different cities. The road network in the kingdom is such that people of any city can reach any other city they desired through the road network. This is called having unity in the kingdom. Bytelandia is very famous for its unity. The people are united and familiar with each other. The king of Bytelandia is also very proud of this fact. But, some people just want to watch the world burn. Dr. Bobo is one of such people. He is very wicked. He doesn't like unity of Bytelandia. He has a chemical missile to spread diseases. He plans to attack one of the cities of Bytelandia. The king's secret intelligence service became aware of Dr. Bobo's wicked plan and informed the king about it. The king could not catch Dr. Bobo hence he is a genius. So the king planned the rescue mission with his own defense system. The scientists of Bytelandia have made one kind of shields which can protect an entire city from the attack of Dr. Bobo's missile. The shield will not affect the road network, in the sense that a citizen can still travel on the roads connected to a protected city. But the shields are very very expensive to build. The king also has a team of brilliant doctors, who have already discovered the cure for the disease which the missile will spread. But they can only handle one city at a time. The king has planned his rescue mission as follows: If a shielded city is attacked by the missile, then no one is harmed. If a city without a shield is attacked, all the roads connected to that city will be closed to prevent the disease from spreading to the other cities. Then, the doctors will begin to cure each citizen of that city and as a precautionary measure, none of those citizens are allowed to leave the city until each and every of them is cured. It will take a very long time to cure an entire city. Taking a long time to cure an attacked city will affect the road network of the kingdom. The roads which are closed due to the attack can not be used until the affected city is entirely cured. This would have an adverse affect on the kingdom's unity, which the king would never want, especially at the time of crisis because in that case Dr. Bobo would have achieved his evil goal of dividing the people. The king can make as many shields as he wants but as we know, they are very expensive. So, he would let a city be attacked and then be cured by his doctors rather than pay to plant a shield over a city, as long as it will not affect the unity of the remaining kingdom. That is, city x must be protected by the shield if there exists a pair of cities (except city x) such that people cannot come and go between these cities when the roads connected city x are closed. He doesn't want to make unnecessary shields. He wants you to find the minimum amount of money that is needed to make the shields to prevent Mr. Bobo from succeeding in his evil plan.

Chefs and Voting for best friend ,"There is a festival in Chefland in which each chef is asked to vote a person as his best friend. Obviously, a person can't vote himself as his best friend. Note that the best friend relationship is not necessarily bi-directional, i.e. it might be possible that x is best friend of y, but y is not a best friend of x. Devu was the election commissioner who conducted this voting. Unfortunately, he was sleeping during the voting time. So, he could not see the actual vote of each person, instead after the voting, he counted the number of votes of each person and found that number of votes of i-th person was equal to ci. Now he is wondering whether this distribution of votes corresponds to some actual voting or some fraudulent voting has happened. If the current distribution of votes does not correspond to any real voting, print -1. Otherwise, print any one of the possible voting which might have lead to the current distribution.

Devu and a light discussion ,"One day, Devu and Churu were involved in a light discussion about finding the diameter of an undirected unweighted connected graph. Diameter of a graph is the maximum value of pairwise shortest distances over all pairs of vertices of the graph. Churu proposed the following algorithm which takes a parameter start_vertex. Algorithm (start_vertex): find out the set of vertices S having maximum value of shortest distance from start_vertex. ans = 0; for each vertex v in S temp = 0; for each vertex u in graph G: temp = max(temp, shortest distance between u and v). ans = max(ans, temp); return ans; When Devu heard this algorithm, he exclaimed: ""What, this does not seem to be correct!"". Churu challenged him to give a counter example to disprove the algorithm. You have to help Devu come up with a graph as a counter example to the above algorithm, if one exists. Formally, You will be given an integer n denoting the number of nodes of the expected graph (counter example Devu is producing). The graph should be undirected, unweighted and connected. The actual diameter of the graph should not be equal to the one returned by the Churu's proposed algorithm. If for the given n, there does not exist any such graph which could act as counter example, print -1.

Vibrating Paths (Challenge) ,"You are given an undirected weighted graph with N vertices (numbered 1 through N) and M edges (numbered 1 through M). For each valid i, the i-th edge has weight SiSiS_i and connects vertices uiuiu_i and viviv_i. The weights of all edges are pairwise distinct. Let's denote an edge that connects vertices u and v by (u,v)(u,v)(u,v). A vibrating path is a sequence of distinct vertices V1,V2,…,VKV1,V2,…,VKV_1, V_2, ldots, V_K such that the following conditions are satisfied: 1≤K≤2561≤K≤2561 le K le 256 For each valid i, the edge (Vi,Vi+1)(Vi,Vi+1)(V_i, V_{i+1}) exists in the graph. For each valid i and j≤i−2j≤i−2j le i-2, the edge (Vi,Vj)(Vi,Vj)(V_i, V_j) does not exist in the graph. For each valid i: If i>1i>1i gt 1, let's consider the graph without the edge (Vi−1,Vi)(Vi−1,Vi)(V_{i-1}, V_i); otherwise, consider the original graph. In this graph, the weight of the edge (Vi,Vi+1)(Vi,Vi+1)(V_i, V_{i+1}) is the minimum of weights of all edges adjacent to ViViV_i. A graph is K-vertex-colourable if is possible to paint its vertices using at most K distinct colours in such a way that no edge connects two vertices with the same colour. Your task is to make the graph K-vertex-colourable by hitting the vertices. When a vertex u is hit, all the edges on the vibrating path with maximum length that starts at u are removed (note that this path is unique). You may hit vertices any number of times and in any order. However, each time you hit a vertex, at least one edge must be removed. For each valid i, the cost of hitting the i-th vertex is CiCiC_i. You should make the graph K-vertex-colourable and find one valid way to paint its vertices using K colours (numbered 1 through K). If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one. Then, the sum of costs of all hits you perform should be as small as possible. Tags: alei, alei, challenge-problem, graph-coloring, graphs, sept20 ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/VBR,CC

However, the sellers are very competitive, and they will change prices based on other sellers nearby. You have a simple graph (unweighted, undirected graph containing no self-loops or multiple edges) G with N vertices and M edges. There is an edge between two sellers if and only if they are neighbours. When you buy a mango from a seller numbered X, the following occurs: Seller X keeps his price the same. Every seller Y who is a neighbour of X increases their price by 1, that is, AY=AY+1AY=AY+1A_Y = A_Y + 1 for every Y who is a neighbour of X. Every other seller Z who is not a neighbour of X decreases their price by 1; that is, AZ=AZ−1AZ=AZ−1A_Z = A_Z - 1 for every Z who is not a neighbour of X. Prices can become zero or negative during this process. Now you should process Q queries of the following three types: ++text{+} u v — Add an edge between nodes u and v in the graph. It's guaranteed there is no edge between u and v currently. --text{-} u v — Remove an edge between nodes u and v in the graph. It's guaranteed there is an edge between u and v currently. ??text{?} — Find the minimum amount of money you need to pay so that you can buy exactly one mango from every seller.

Snakes and Graph ,"There is a graph consisting of n nodes and m edges. There is a snake in each of its nodes. These snakes want to stage a coup against the mongoose who controls and puts restrictions on various aspects of their life. If there is an edge between some two nodes, then it means that the snakes in those nodes can talk with each other. The mongoose wants to protect himself against the coup. First, he calculates the degree of each node, i.e. the number of snakes a snake can talk to. He starts with an integer d = 0 and goes till d = n - 1. At each such d, he will select the set of nodes that have their degree (the originally computed degree, because the mongoose doesn't like to compute the degree each time) less than or equal to d. He will remove all the edges whose one or both the endpoints belong to this set. The snakes want to find, for each d, the minimum number of edges (or communication channels) that they should add so that each of the snakes is able to talk to every other snake either directly via an edge or via other snakes indirectly.

Petr Contest ,"Petr is organizing Petr Mitrichev Contest #11. The top N coders according to codechef ratings (excluding Petr himself) agreed to participate in the contest. The participants have been ranked from 0 to N-1 according to their ratings. Petr had asked each participant to choose a coder with rating higher than himself/ herself, whom he/she would like to be team-mates with, and the ith ranked coder's choice is stored as choice[i]. As expected, programmers turned out to be lazy, and only a few of them actually filled in their choices. If choice[i] = -1, then it means the ith coder was lazy and did not fill his/her choice. Of course, the top-ranked person (i.e., rank = 0), Gennady Korotkevich (obviously), despite clearly not being a lazy person, was not able to fill any choice, because he is the top ranked coder, so choice[0] is always equal to -1. Petr, being the organizer, had to undertake the arduous task of filling in the choices for the lazy participants. Unfortunately, he also got lazy and adopted the following random strategy: For each lazy person i (i.e., for all i > 0, such that choice[i] = -1), he flips an unbiased coin (i.e. with 1/2 probability it lands Heads, and with 1/2 probability it lands Tails). Notice that no coin is flipped for i=0, since Gennady is not lazy despite his choice being -1. If it lands Heads, he will not change the choice of this person. That is, he leaves choice[i] as -1. Otherwise, if it lands Tails, he will uniformly at random select one of the top i ranked participants as choice of ith person. That is, he sets choice[i] = j, where j is randomly and uniformly chosen from 0 to i-1, inclusive. After this process of filling the choice array, Petr is wondering about the maximum number of teams he can have such that all the valid choices are respected (i.e. if choice[i] = j and j != -1, then i and j should be in the same team). Petr now has to arrange for computers. As each team will need a computer, he wants to know the expected value of maximum number of teams.

The destination cell must be empty, and must lie within the bounds of the grid. Note that you cannot move a piece directly from (x, y) to (x-1, y-1) or (x+1, y+1). A jump consists of moving a piece from (x, y) to (x+2, y), (x-2, y), (x, y+2), (x, y-2), (x+2, y-2), or (x-2, y+2). Not only must the destination cell be empty and lie within the bounds of the grid, but the cell between the source and destination cells must contain a piece. A turn consists of either a single step, or a sequence of one or more jumps where the same piece is moved with each jump. The goal is to move the pieces to the goal configuration in as few turns as possible. The goal configuration is such that each cell (x, y) contains a piece if and only if x+y < P.

Also, every second any drop which wasn't already on the root node moves one node closer to the root. Sometimes, strong winds shake the tree and all drops which were not on the root fall off. It is known that the wind will shake the tree M times at A1,A2,…AMA1,A2,…AMA_1, A_2, ldots A_M seconds after it started raining. If multiple events happen at the same second, they are in this order: Raindrops move one node closer to the root. New raindrops fall on the leaves. Wind shakes the tree. How many drops are there at the root right after the M-th shake?

Chef and collection of stamps ,"Chef has a collection of N postage stamps. Each stamp belongs to some type, which are enumerated as positive integers. More valuable stamps have a higher enumerated type. So, type 1 is the least valuable type of stamps, type 2 is a bit more valuable, and so on. Chef often communicates with other philatelists via a stamp exchange website called P-bay. On any particular day, P-bay lists several offers, each of which is represented as an unordered pair {A, B}, allowing its users to exchange stamps of type A with an equal number of stamps of type B. Chef can use such an offer to put up any number of stamps of enumerated type A on the website and get the same number of stamps of type B in return, or vice-versa (of course, he must have enough stamps of the corresponding type). Assume that any number of stamps Chef wants are always available on the site's exchange market. Each offer is open during only one day: Chef can't use it after this day, but he can use it several times during this day. If there are some offers which are active during a given day, Chef can use them in any order. Chef is interested in making his collection as valuable as possible. Help him to find maximum possible value of his collection after going through (accepting or declining) all the offers. Value of Chef's collection is equal to the sum of type enumerations of all stamps in the collection.

Single Point of Failure ,"Chef has always dreamed of becoming an employee of the ""Hack and Manipulate Group"". Their work is simple ― attacking networks. They gave Chef the following task to assess his programming skills, but Chef is too busy cooking ""Vegetable Gourmet"". Can you solve the task for him? A network consists of N nodes (numbered 1 through N) and M bidirectional connections between pairs of these nodes. A robust network is a network that contains a cycle. Shutting down a node means removing that node (and all direct connections it is part of) from the network. You may shut down at most one node. If the network was robust before it was shut down and is not robust afterwards, this node is called the point of failure. Is the initial network robust? If it is robust, does it have a point of failure? If it does, find the point of failure with the smallest number.

Ranka ,"There is an ancient legend in China called (Content taken from wikipedia) Wang Chih was a hardy young fellow who used to venture deep into the mountains to find suitable wood for his axe. One day he went farther than usual and became lost. He wandered about for a while and eventually came upon two strange old men who were playing Go, their board resting on a rock between them. Wang Chih was fascinated. He put down his axe and began to watch. One of the players gave him something like a date to chew on, so that he felt neither hunger nor thirst. As he continued to watch he fell into a trance for what seemed like an hour or two. When he awoke, however, the two old men were no longer there. He found that his axe handle had rotted to dust and he had grown a long beard. When he returned to his native village he discovered that his family had disappeared and that no one even remembered his name. So how could that happen? Well, that's because the game ""Go"" can played very long. Let's first define the game ""Go"": In this game, we focus on the game played on a 9x9 board. It is a game played by 2 players. A plays black stone while B plays white. They play alternatively. A goes first. In each cell there can be 3 states: empty, having 1 black stone and having 1 white stone. If we link the same color stones which are neighbourhood (|x1-x2| + |y1-y2| = 1), we can get some connected component. We say a connected component is dead if no stone in it has an empty neighbourhood cell. In each move, the player must put the stone on an empty cell or pass the turn. If this player put a stone, following situation will happen. If after this move there is at least one connected component of opponent dead, then stones from these dead components will be removed. (In this case, after remove all dead components of your opponent, we can prove all your connected component are not dead.) Otherwise, if there are at least one connected component of yours dead, then this move is invalid. In order to avoid infinite loops, there is a rule called ""No same state"". The state of board can be expressed as a string with length 82: the first character indicate who is the next player, then 9*9 character indicate the state of a certain cell. If after one move the game goes into a state that previously occurred, then this move is invalid. You are given an integer N. Please output a match that contains N valid moves for both player. You can find details for the rules in the judge program here.

Kingdom Attack ,"Ratan Singh and Alauddin Khilji are blood-enemies of each other. Ratan Singh has a diverse and well planned kingdom. His kingdom has N provinces. Every province has a bidirectional road to every other province (except itself of course). But Alauddin has now attacked his kingdom. During his attack, he destroyed some of the roads connecting provinces. To fight back, Ratan Singh divided his sena(army) into two senas. Sena X and Sena Y. Sena X has the best warriors, while Sena Y doesn’t. According to his plan, each province should be protected by exactly one of the two senas( X or Y). As Sena X is very strong, Ratan Singh will place them in such a way that: No two adjacent provinces (provinces connected by a road) are guarded by Sena X. If a province P is guarded by Sena X, then all the provinces which are guarded by Sena Y needs to be adjacent to province P. There should exist at least one province having Sena X, and at least one province having Sena Y. This way, he can ensure the safety of his Kingdom. You are the only programmer that Khilji has.

Sadly people in the capital city of Chefland (denoted by 'C') are lazy for their shopping. So they invented a robot for carrying their groceries. They want to feed a command of at max 105 characters to the robot such that if the robot starts from any cell (non-prohibited) of the grid, it should be able to visit the capital city during its walk. Each character of the command will be one of 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R' denoting the movement to go up, down, left and right cell from the current cell (provided it exists and the cell is not prohibited to visit). Otherwise, the robot will just stay at its current cell. The characters of the command will be followed in the order from left to right. Now, after thinking a lot, citizens of Chefland could not come up such a command to feed to robot. So, they ask your help in it.

Hidden Colored Graph ,"This is an interactive problem. There is a hidden undirected graph with n vertices. There are no self-loops or multiple edges. Each vertex is colored black or white, and the colors are also hidden from you. To make a query, you choose a vertex v. The interactor will respond with the current color of v, and then it will flip the colors of all vertices adjacent to v. A vertex is not considered adjacent to itself, so the color of v doesn't change. After at most 606060 queries, find the adjacency matrix of the graph. Note: The interactor is not adaptive. In other words, the graph and colors are fixed in the beginning. Interaction Begin the interaction by reading a single integer n - the number of vertices in the graph. To ask a query, output ""? v"" for a vertex v (1≤v≤n1≤v≤n1le vle n). Then read a single character describing the current color of v, where ""B"" denotes black and ""W"" denotes white. After making this query, the colors of all vertices adjacent to v will flip. To print the answer, output ""!"" then on the next n lines print n strings of length n, consisting of symbols ""0"" and ""1"". The j-th character of the i-th string should be ""1"" if and only if there is an edge between vertices i and j. Since there are no self-loops, the main diagonal should contain only ""0"". If at any time you make an invalid query or exceed the query limit, the interaction is terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Remember to flush the output after printing each line!

Corruption in Freedonia ,"Corruption is on the rise in the country of Freedonia, Gru's home. This corruption network can be represented in the form of a tree having N nodes and N−1N−1N-1 edges. The nodes are numbered from 1 to N, and the tree is rooted at node 1. These nodes represent the corrupt officials and each corrupt official works under some other corrupt official (except the Boss, who is represented by node 1). Gru believes in divide and conquer and thinks that this network needs to be divided into as many sub-networks as possible. To achieve this, the following operation can be applied by the minions any number of times (even 0): In one operation, the minions can select any one leaf node official (that is, an official who does not have any other official beneath him) in the graph and kill him along with all his ancestors. This operation deletes those nodes, along with all of their edges/connections from the graph. Hence after applying this operation on any tree, it breaks into some connected components which are also trees, which are the new sub-networks. Now the minions are a bit lazy and will do the task someday, but they need to submit a report to Gru as soon as possible.

Convenient Airports ,"Chefland is a big nation which relies on its airport system to guarantee fast travel. Currently, there are N airports (numbered 1 through N) and M bidirectional flights in Chefland. Each flight connects two distinct airports, but there may be any number of flights between each pair of airports. We say that a system of flights is connected if it is possible to travel from each airport to all other airports using these flights. For each airport i, we also define its degree didid_i as the number of flights that have i as one of their endpoints. Unfortunately, it turns out that the current flight system is not necessarily connected. This is unacceptable, so the mayor asked you to propose a new flight system. Formally, this means that you can remove some of the existing flights (possibly none) and arbitrarily create some new flights (possibly none). You may even create multiple flights between the same pairs of airports. However, the infrastructure and number of employees at each airport is optimised for its current degree didid_i, so it would be inconvenient if the new degrees of airports differ too much from the old ones. For each airport i, let's define xixix_i as the degree of airport i in the new proposed system of flights. We define the inconvenience of this system as ∑Ni=1|di−xi|∑i=1N|di−xi|sum_{i=1}^N |d_i-x_i|. You should propose a connected system of flights such that its inconvenience is the smallest possible. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.

Mike was asked to assign labels to each edge of the graph so that the following condition is satisfied: Let's suppose that the j'th edge of G connects vertices Uj and Vj. Then, a non-negative integer Yj equals to XUj xor XVj. This challenge was too easy for Mike and he solved it quickly. The next day, Mike started to worry that he had solved the problem too quickly and had made a lot of mistakes, so he decided to double-check his answers. To his horror, Mike discovered that all the values of Xi had been lost! Mike is a very meticulous person and he doesn't like making mistakes, so he decided to create his own values of Xi that still produce the same values of Yj. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to do so. If it is, you should output the K'th lexicographically valid sequence (X1, X2, ., XN) that satisfies the above conditions, knowing the structure of G and all the values Yj. Note Maybe some of you aren't familiar with some terms in the statement. Here are some articles that could help you understand the problem correctly: XOR operation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or Also, the stack memory size is quite limited on CodeChef, so a deep recursion may lead to the Runtime Error verdict.

Short in Average ,"There are a lot of problems related to the shortest paths. Nevertheless, there are not much problems, related to the shortest paths in average. Consider a directed graph G, consisting of N nodes and M edges. Consider a walk from the node A to the node B in this graph. The average length of this walk will be total sum of weight of its' edges divided by number of edges. Every edge counts as many times as it appears in this path. Now, your problem is quite simple. For the given graph and two given nodes, find out the shortest average length of the walk between these nodes. Please note, that the length of the walk need not to be finite, but average walk length will be.

Call Center Schedule ,"Chef is working as a manager of a call center. He has a large number of empoyees in his team. Each of them spends their time participating in meetings, talking to clients over the phone, and a few other activities related to the job. Each person can spend an hour either in a meeting, talking to clients, or working on their project. Each hour must be dedicated to only one activity and in a single hour, a person cannot switch activities. There are D business days in the week, numbered 1 to D. Person i can spend at most Li hours per week talking to clients. For each person, it is known which hours in their schedule are taken up by meetings. The call center responds to client for H hours per day, which, for simplicity, are numbered 1 through H. For each hour in the week, the number of clients connecting to the call center for that hour is known. So, Chef knows that he needs exactly Ri,j people talking with clients during the day i and hour j. Fk, i, j is equal to 1 if person k is available to talk to clients during hour j of day i and 0 if they have a meeting during that time. Please note that Chef lives in an alien world, which may not have 24 hours in a day or 7 days in a week. Chef needs to create a schedule for each person. Remember that there is a lunch period every day, from LTbegin to LTend hours, both inclusive , so please make sure that each person will have at least one hour of free time during the designated lunch period. If some person doesn't have a meeting during an hour and they don't talk to a client as well during that hour, they can work on a corporate project and this hour will count as a working hour. Alternatively, they may spend this time working on a personal project and it will not count as a working hour. Please help Chef find out if it is possible to create a schedule such that following conditions hold. Each person spends at most N hours per day being on meetings and speaking with clients. Each person spends at most Li hours per week talking to clients. Each person has at least one hour during the lunch time free of client calls as well as meetings. For each hour j on the day i, there are exactly Ri,j people free to talk to clients.

Future of draughts ,"2367. The Earth. The world we know doesn't exist anymore. All has been changed during the inevitable evolution, but only Chef retains his former self. Peoples don’t play ordinary draughts we know, mankind has enhanced it. Present games are held on an undirected graph, instead of the board. Before a game starts, one player chooses a vertex of the graph and puts a checker (called the game checker) on it. Then the players take turns alternately. In a single turn, a player moves the game checker from its current vertex, say v, to some neighbour (see note) of v. The game goes on until one of the players surrenders. The player who moves last is considered as the winner. This game may seems to you confusing. Strange even, and imperfect, but don’t bother about it. Chef would like to become the best in this game so he needs training. During training, Chef plays by himself. Being very tired, all of his moves are absolutely random as well as his choice for the initial position of the game checker. He has T game-graphs (indexed 1 to T), and a very tiresome trainer who forces him to train again and again. For the ith training session, the trainer gives 3 numbers to Chef: Li, Ri, and Ki. Chef has to carry out a few simultaneous games against himself on game-graphs indexed between Li and Ri (both included). Specifically, after the trainer gives him such an order, for each game-graph in range Li … Ri Chef randomly sets initial position of the game checker. Further, for each of the following steps, he should choose a random non-empty subset of the set of allowed game-graphs. Then he randomly moves one checker in all of these chosen game-graphs. The whole training ends after finite number of steps if the set of current positions after last step is the same as the set of initial positions. Note that Chef must make at least one move during this training. The trainer wants Q training sessions, as described above, and for each one of them Chef would like to know how many ways of his play lead to the whole training ending within Ki steps or less. Since the answer could be very large, print it modulo 1007.

DELHI Traffic ,"In DELHI,, there are junctions connected by roads. There is at most one road between any pair of junctions. There is no road connecting a junction to itself. The travel time for a road is the same in both directions. At every junction there is a single traffic light. These traffic lights are a bit peculiar. Starting from time 0, each light flashes green once every T time units, where the value of T is different for each junction. A vehicle that is at a junction can start moving along a road only when the light at the current junction flashes green. If a vehicle arrives at a junction between green flashes, it must wait for the next green flash before continuing in any direction. If it arrives at a junction at exactly the same time that the light flashes green, it can immediatly proceed along any road originating from that junction. You are given a city map that shows travel times for all roads. For each junction i, you are given Ti, the time period between green flashes of the light at that junction. Your task is to find the minimum time taken from a given source junction to a given destination junction for a vehicle when the traffic starts.

Machine Gun ,"Country X has a military zone framed as a grid of size MxN. Each point of the grid could be free, occupied by a machine gun or by a protector. A machine gun at point (x, y) could automatically attack other guns at points (x-2, y-2), (x-2, y+2), (x+2, y-2) and (x+2, y+2). So we could not put two guns at points which make them destroy each others, unless there is a protector exactly in the middle. Eg.: We could put two guns at point (x, y) and (x+2, y+2) if and only if there is a protector at point (x+1, y+1). Given a map with some points which has been occupied by guns or protectors, your task is to find out the greatest number of guns to add to this map satisfying rules above. Note that we can put a machine gun at a free point, but we cannot remove any machine gun and protector, and we cannot add protectors.

Roll the Bar ,"You are given a 1×1×21×1×21 times 1 times 2 bar (a cuboid) and a grid A with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M). Let's denote the cell in row r and column c by (r,c)(r,c)(r, c). Some cells of the grid are blocked, the remaining cells are free. Each cell has dimensions 1×11×11 times 1, the same as two opposite faces of the cuboid. When the bar is placed on the grid in such a way that one of its two 1×11×11 times 1 faces fully covers a cell (r,c)(r,c)(r, c), we say that the bar is standing on the cell (r,c)(r,c)(r, c). Initially, the bar is standing on a cell (x,y)(x,y)(x, y). When the bar is placed on the grid, one of its faces is touching the grid; this face is called the base. In one move, you must roll the bar over one of its base edges (sides of the base); this base edge does not move and the bar is rotated 90∘90∘90^circ around it in such a way that it is still lying on the grid, but with a different base. In different moves, the bar may be rotated around different edges in different directions. After each move, the base of the bar must lie fully inside the grid and it must not cover any blocked cells. An example sequence of moves is shown here. For each cell of the grid, determine the minimum number of moves necessary to achieve the state where the bar is standing on this cell or determine that it is impossible to achieve.

Number Game ,"You are playing a game with a robot. The game starts with two integers: A and M. The robot makes exactly one move in the entire game, and it does so at the very beginning - it will remove exactly 1 digit from A and output it as the starting value (say X). Note that the value A remains intact. It is not changed by the robot. After the robot makes its moves, it is your turn. You can make an unlimited number of moves. In each move, you must remove exactly 1 digit from A and append it to X (to the right side of X). Again note that none of your moves change the value of A. You win if you can eventually make X a multiple of M (i.e. X mod M = 0). How many possible starting moves bot can make such that you are guaranteed to win assuming you play optimally? Here is an example of a game: Suppose the numbers are A = 1003, M = 4. The robot can make four possible starting moves: 003 by removing 1st digit, 103 by removing 2nd or 3rd digit (both count as a separate possibilities even though the starting X will be same) or 100 by removing the 4th digit. Let us say the robot chooses 003 as the starting move. Then you can win by appending 100 (by removing the 4th digit) making X = 003100 which is divisible by 4.

Clarke and Australian Cricket Team ,"Michael Clarke is Secretary of the Australian Cricket Club. When the club gathers together, the players behave badly due to their bad performance in the Cricket World Cup 2015. They've brought lots of ropes to the club and got tied with each other. Specifically, each rope ties together two players. Also, if two players are tied together, then the rope connects the first player with the second one as well as the second player with the first one. As Captain Clarke is already angry at their bad performance, this scenario got him more angrier. In his anger and frustration, Clarke does the following. First, for each player, Clarke finds out what other players he is tied to. If a player is tied to exactly one other player, Clarke reprimands him. Then Clarke gathers in a single group all the players who have been just reprimanded. He then throws them out from the club. This group of players immediately leaves the club. These players takes with them the ropes that used to tie them. Then again for every players Clarke finds out how many other players he is tied to and so on. And they do so until Clarke can reprimand at least one player. He doesn't even care if the club gets empty in the process. Determine how many groups of players will be thrown out of the club.

Some cells of this grid are blocked. Initially, there are also S snakes present in S non-blocked cells. The snakes do not grow, so each snake always takes up exactly one cell. The game starts at second 0 and will run for T seconds. At the end of each second, each snake may (independently from the other snakes) move to an edge-adjacent non-blocked cell or stay in its current cell. During each second, there may be at most one snake in each cell, but when a snake is moving out of a cell, another snake is allowed to move into that cell at the same time. During these T seconds, Z apple trees (numbered 1 through Z) will grow in some cells, bear fruit and wither. For each valid i, the i-th tree will grow in the cell in row XiXiX_i and column YiYiY_i and start bearing fruit at a time PiPiP_i. At a later time QiQiQ_i, the tree will wither and bear no fruit.

Eating one apple from the tree increases the total happiness of the snakes by HiHiH_i; if a snake eats multiple apples from this tree, the happiness increases by HiHiH_i multiple times. Each snake takes 1 second to eat an apple. It cannot do anything else while eating and if there are multiple trees bearing fruit in the same cell, a snake in that cell may only eat an apple from one tree during each second (possibly from different trees during different seconds).

There was a secret message of the enemy intercepted which tells that enemy is going to attack the roads of the country. If an enemy attacks a particular road then that road becomes unusable. Let us say that those roads which do not stop movement from one city to another if they are destroyed are called strong roads. In other words, a road is called strong road if after removal of only this road out of M roads in graph there remains a path between any two cities. Roads which are not strong are referred as weak roads. Enemy is going to destroy all the weak roads of a country. Cities which are connected to at least K strong roads are called strong cities and rest are weak cities. Government decided to move all citizens which are in weak cities to strong cities. For each weak city, find out the distance to nearest strong city. Find sum of all such distances. If there does not exist a path to strong city from some weak city then the population of this weak citiy cannot be saved from enemy attack. Find the sum of population which cannot be saved from enemy attack.

Supercomputers ,"NASA is building a new super-computer. For this they are designing a new OS. All the processes that are running on the computer at a time are assigned an integer by the OS, which is called ’ factor ’. Each process has its own factor assigned to it. G(k) is a function which gives the factor of process k. The running processes can be represented by the nodes of a tree. If process B is a descendant of process A in the tree, then B is called the sub-process of process A and A is called the super-process of B.At the root of the tree is Process ‘Top’. All the other processes are its sub-processes. F(x,y) is a function which determines the performance of the super-computer. Here (x,y) is that pair of processes (y is always a sub-process of process x) where the difference between the factors of process x and process y is maximum.

Stacks ,"As every other little boy, Mike has a favorite toy to play with. Mike's favorite toy is a set of N disks. The boy likes to compose his disks in stacks, but there's one very important rule: the disks in a single stack must be ordered by their radiuses in a strictly increasing order such that the top-most disk will have the smallest radius. For example, a stack of disks with radii (5, 2, 1) is valid, while a stack of disks with radii (3, 4, 1) is not. Little Mike has recently come up with the following algorithm after the order of disks are given: First, Mike initiates an empty set of disk stacks. Then, Mike processes the disks in the chosen order using the following pattern: If there is at least one stack such that Mike can put the current disk on the top of the stack without making it invalid, then he chooses the stack with the smallest top disk radius strictly greater than the radius of the current disk, and puts the current disk on top of that stack. Otherwise, Mike makes a new stack containing only the current disk. For example, let's assume that the order of the disk radii is (3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 2). Here's how the set of the top stack disks will appear during the algorithm's run: In the beginning of the algorithm, the set of disk stacks is empty. After processing the first disk, the set of top stack disks is {3}. We cannot put the second disk on the only stack that we have after processing the first disk, so we make a new stack. After processing the second disk, the set of top stack disks is {3, 4}. We cannot put the third disk on any of the available stacks, so we make a new stack. After processing the third disk, the set of top stack disks is {3, 4, 5}. The fourth disk has radius 1, so it can be easily put on any of the available stacks. According to the algorithm, we choose the stack with the top disk radius equal to 3. After processing the fourth disk, the set of top stack disks is {1, 4, 5}. The fifth disk has radius 1, so there are two stacks we can put it on. According to the algorithm, we choose the stack with the top disk radius equal to 4. After processing the fifth disk, the set of top stack disks is {1, 1, 5}. The sixth disk has radius 2, so there is only one stack we can put it on. The final set of top stack disks is {1, 1, 2}. Mike is really excited about his new algorithm, but he has so many disks that it seems impossible to simulate the algorithm manually. You are given an array A of N integers denoting the radii of Mike's disks. The disks are already ordered by Mike. Your task is to find the set of the stack top disk radii after the algorithm is done.

Snake Eating ,"The Chef has acquired a vicious bunch of snakes, and these snakes are ever hungry and end up eating each other. In particular, each snake i has a length Li, whose initial value is given to you. A snake can eat any other snake which is not longer than itself. That is, snake i can eat snake j (i ≠ j), if Li ≥ Lj. And when a snake eats another snake, its length increases by 1. That is, Li increases by 1. A snake can eat multiple other snakes. The Chef doesn't care about snakes eating each other. All he wants is to have as many snakes as possible, which are at least some particular lengths long. You are given Q values: K1, K2, .., KQ. Treat each of them independently and output the answer for each.

Chef would like to make sure that she can finish eating all bananas by that time. Suppose Chef has an eating speed of K bananas per hour. Each hour, she will choose some pile of bananas. If this pile contains at least K bananas, then she will eat K bananas from it. Otherwise, she will simply eat the whole pile (and won't eat any more bananas during this hour). Chef likes to eat slowly, but still wants to finish eating all the bananas on time. Therefore, she would like to choose the minimum K such that she is able to eat all the bananas in H hours.

Equal Beauty ,"The beauty of an (non-empty) array of integers is defined as the difference between its largest and smallest element. For example, the beauty of the array [2,3,4,4,6][2,3,4,4,6][2,3,4,4,6] is 6−2=46−2=46 - 2 = 4. An array A is said to be good if it is possible to partition the elements of A into two non-empty arrays B1B1B_1 and B2B2 B_2 such that B1B1B_1 and B2B2 B_2 have the same beauty. Each element of array A should be in exactly one array: either in B1B1B_1 or in B2B2B_2. For example, the array [6,2,4,4,4][6,2,4,4,4][6, 2, 4, 4, 4] is good because its elements can be partitioned into two arrays B1=[6,4,4]B1=[6,4,4]B_1 = [6, 4, 4] and B2=[2,4]B2=[2,4]B_2 = [2, 4], where both B1B1B_1 and B2B2B_2 have the same beauty (6−4=4−2=26−4=4−2=26-4 = 4-2 = 2). You are given an array A of length N. In one move you can: Select an index i (1≤i≤N)(1≤i≤N)(1leq i leq N) and either increase AiAiA_i by 1 or decrease AiAiA_i by 1.

Saving a gift of love ,"Suraj, the Chief Prankster is back in action now and this time he has stolen the valentine's day gift given by Ashi (the love of Chef) to the Chef and ran away with it to Byteland. Byteland is a not a regular place like Chef's town. The safest way from Chef's town to Byteland is through the path of tasty dishes. The path is named so because there are magical tasty dishes which appear to the traveler that no one can resist eating. Also, Suraj has added a strong sleep potion to each of the dish on this path to stop anyone from following him. Knowing the devilish nature of Suraj, Ashi is concerned about the Chef and has asked all of Chef's town people to help. The distance from Chef's town to Byteland through the the path of tasty dishes is X units. They have the location where the magic dishes are and how many people are required to eat it completely. Anyone who eats a dish would go to a long sleep and won't be able to continue. They have the information about the tribal clans that live along the the path of tasty dishes who can be of real help in this journey. The journey Chef and his friends can be described as follows: There is a total of B dishes on the path of tasty dishes. Each dish is located at some distance from Chef's town denoted by xi for the ith dish ( xi-1 < xi). To minimize the number of friends Chef has to leave behind, all of them have decided that exactly yi of them will eat the ith dish, which is the required number of people needed to finish it completely. Also, there are a total of C tribal chef clans, each with their own population and location on the path that Chef and his friends will meet on their way to Byteland. They know that for some clan (say i), they are located at a distance of pi ( pi-1 < pi) from Chef's town with a population of ri.

The teacher was expecting a linear search algorithm, but since Chef is such an amazing programmer, he decided to write the following binary search function: integer binary_search(array a, integer n, integer x): integer low, high, mid low := 1 high := n while low ≤ high: mid := (low + high) / 2 if a[mid] == x: break else if a[mid] is less than x: low := mid+1 else: high := mid-1 return mid All of Chef's classmates have copied his code and submitted it to the teacher. Chef later realised that since he forgot to sort the array, the binary search algorithm may not work. Luckily, the teacher is tired today, so she asked Chef to assist her with grading the codes. Each student's code is graded by providing an array A and an integer X to it and checking if the returned index is correct. However, the teacher is lazy and provides the exact same array to all codes. The only thing that varies is the value of X. Chef was asked to type in the inputs. He decides that when typing in the input array for each code, he's not going to use the input array he's given, but an array created by swapping some pairs of elements of this original input array. However, he cannot change the position of the element that's equal to X itself, since that would be suspicious.

Bear and House Queries ,"This is an interactive problem. It means that every time you output something, you must finish with a newline character and flush the output. For example, in C++ use the fflush(stdout) function, in Java — call System.out.flush(), in Python — sys.stdout.flush(), and in Pascal — flush(output). Only after flushing the output will you be able to read from the input again. Limak is a little bear. He has made a drawing of his house for you! To get it, you must first play a game with him (little bears love playing games). The drawing shows a building with a roof on the top. The building is represented by a square and the roof by an isosceles triangle in the coordinate system. Formally, the following conditions are guaranteed: Both the square and the triangle are non-degenerate, i.e their areas are positive, and not zero. The bottom side of the triangle is its base. The bottom side of the square lies on the x-axis, while the top side is a part of the base of the triangle. The base of the triangle is longer that the side of the square. The whole drawing is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. All vertices of the square and the triangle have integer coordinates, and their absolute values do not exceed 10. All y-coordinates are non-negative. An example of a valid drawing: Your task is to find the total area of the house (the sum of areas of the square and the triangle). To achieve that, you are allowed to ask at most 100 queries. In each query you choose some point with integer coordinates and the system will tell you if this point is in the house (including its boundary). Interaction At most 100 times, you can ask a query by printing ""? x y"" (without the quotes) in a singe line. Coordinates x and y should be integers such that -10 ≤ x ≤ 10 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 10. After flushing the output you should read a response that is a string ""YES"" or ""NO"" (without the quotes) in a single line. A response ""YES"" means that the point (x, y) is inside the house or on its boundary, while ""NO"" means that it's outside. Finally you should print the answer in the form ""! S"" (without the quotes) where S is an integer denoting the area of the house (it can be proved that it must be integer). Then terminate your program. Notes For each test the house is fixed and it doesn't change during queries. It's even allowed to guess the area and print the answer as ""! S"" without asking any queries. But obviously asking queries first might be useful. After submitting your program you will see which tests it passes. The first test there (""task # 0"") matches the example test and drawings from this statement. Asking more than 100 queries or printing invalid coordinates (not from allowed range) results in the verdict WA (wrong answer). Printing the answer doesn't count as asking a query. In particular, you can ask exactly 100 queries and print the answer after that . You can't ask more queries after printing the answer. You can ask the same query more than once. Subtasks Subtask #1 (35 points) The absolute values of the coordinates of vertices don't exceed 10. Subtask #2 (65 points) Original constraints (absolute values of coordinates can be up to 10) Example you system ? 1 0 YES ? 2 2 YES ? -3 0 NO ? -1 3 YES ? -1 4 YES ? 7 4 NO ? -3 6 NO ? 2 6 YES ! 34 Explanation The example test matches the drawing from the statement. The square has side 4, while the triangle has base 12 and height 3. The answer is 4 * 4 + 12 * 3 / 2 = 16 + 18 = 34. Above you can see an example of communication with the system. For example, the first query asks about the point (1, 0). It is on the boundary so the response is ""YES"". On the drawing below, blue and red points denote queries with response ""YES"" and ""NO"" respectively.

Cooking Schedule ,"Chef is a well-known chef, and everyone wishes to taste his dishes. As you might know, cooking is not an easy job at all and cooking everyday makes the chef very tired. So, Chef has decided to give himself some days off. Chef has made a schedule for the next N days: On i-th day if Ai is equal to 1 then Chef is going to cook a delicious dish on that day, if Ai is equal to 0 then Chef is going to rest on that day. After Chef made his schedule he discovered that it's not the best schedule, because there are some big blocks of consecutive days where Chef will cook which means it's still tiring for Chef, and some big blocks of consecutive days where Chef is going to rest which means chef will be bored doing nothing during these days. Which is why Chef has decided to make changes to this schedule, but since he doesn't want to change it a lot, he will flip the status of at most K days. So for each day which Chef chooses, he will make it 1 if it was 0 or he will make it 0 if it was 1. Help Chef by writing a program which flips the status of at most K days so that the size of the maximum consecutive block of days of the same status is minimized.

Tic Tac Toe ,"Two drunken players Alice and Bob are playing a modified version of Tic-Tac-Toe. Initially, there is a N×MN×MN times M empty grid. Alice and Bob take alternate turns starting with Alice. In her turn, Alice chooses an empty cell on the board and puts a ""A"" on the chosen cell. In Bob's turn, he chooses an empty cell and puts a ""B"" on the chosen cell. The player who first gets any K×KK×KKtimes K subgrid completely filled with his/her initial wins the game. By a K×KK×KKtimes K subgrid, we mean the intersection of K consecutive rows and K consecutive columns. The players do not stop making turns after one of them wins and they play all N⋅MN⋅MN cdot M turns until the grid is filled. You are given the sequence of moves played by each player (The cell selected by the player in his/her turn). You have to output the winner of the game or report that there is no winner.

Cinema Ticketing Queue ,"There are N people, numbered from 1 to N. They go to a cinema hall. Each of them buys a ticket, which has a number written on it. The number on the ticket of the ithithi^{th} person is AiAiA_i. There are infinite seats in the cinema hall. The seats are numbered sequentially starting from 1. All the N people stand in a queue to get their respective seats. Person 1 stands at the front of the queue, Person 2 stands in the second position of the queue, so on up to Person N who stands at the rear of the queue. They were given seats in this manner: Let the number on the ticket of the person currently standing in front of the queue be X. If the XthXthX^{th} seat is empty, the person gets out of the queue and takes the XthXthX^{th} seat. Otherwise the person goes to the rear of the queue, and the number on his ticket is incremented by one - that is, it becomes X+1X+1X+1. Print the seat number occupied by each of the N people.

Chef and Functions ,"Chef has just been introduced to functions and he has been experimenting a lot with the different kinds of functions. In the process, the chef has come up with an interesting problem for you. Chef defines a function root(i, x) which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to the i th root of a positive integer x . For example, root(2, 4) is 2 and root(2, 2) is 1 . Now the chef defines another function val(x, A, N) as follows : val(x, A, N) = root(1, x)*A[1] + root(2, x)*A[2] + . + root(N, x)*A[N] where A is an array of integers of size N (indexed from 1 onwards) and x is a positive integer. You are given the array A and its size N . You need to find out the value of val(x, A, N) for several values of x . Since this number can be very large, print the result modulo 109 + 7 .

A Story with Strings ,"Lira and her best friend are now ending highschool and soon they both will head separate ways. Lira will obviously study Computer Science while her best friend will study Arts. (apparentely, opposites attract, alikes repel right?) However, as Lira didn't want to lose contact with her, she decided to mix Art and Computer Science one last time and amaze her friend with Computer Science, so she could have a geek coding partner. To amaze her, she encoded a message in two strings, which she presented to her friend: Lira: ""So, Mary, as you can see, we have two strings here, yes? We have a first longer string, S1, which encodes our common path together, and is represented by some letters which represent our lives so far as well all the events we lived together. The second string, S2, will be as long as the first one, or possibly shorter and it is here to represent what the future might bring to both of us :) It is also only composed of letters, which represent some life events we might still experience together in the future. What I would like you to do, is to find out if the future will be just like now, and, for that,you need to find a contiguous sequence of letters in both of these two strings. Obviously, as I want our friendship to last very, very much, I ask you to find the longest sequence of life events we might still experience together and tell me which sequence is it and how long is it :D However, if fate doesn't want us to be together, simply tell me the number 0 and we shall both head separate ways forever.

Devu And Churu ,"Devu and Churu love to play games a lot. Today, they have an array A consisting of N positive integers. First they listed all N × (N+1) / 2 non-empty continuous subarrays of the array A on a piece of paper and then replaced all the subarrays on the paper with the maximum element present in the respective subarray. Devu and Churu decided to play a game with numbers on the paper. They both have decided to make moves turn by turn. In one turn, the player picks some number from the list and discards that number. The one who is not able to make a valid move will be the loser. To make the game more interesting, they decided to put some constraints on their moves. A constraint on a game can be any of following three types : > K : They are allowed to choose numbers having values strictly greater than K only. < K : They are allowed to choose numbers having values strictly less than K only. = K : They are allowed to choose numbers having values equal to K only. Given M constraints and who goes first, you have to tell the outcome of each game. Print 'D' if Devu wins otherwise print 'C' without quotes. Note that M games are independent, that is, they'll rewrite numbers by using array A after each game. (This is the task for the loser of the previous game!)

Destroy the EMP Chip ,"This is an interactive problem. A mysterious organisation has stolen an EMP chip prototype from a high-tech US facility. IGI knows the consequences of the chip falling into the wrong hands. Since it is just a prototype, they wish to destroy it completely instead of attempting to retrieve it. The best opportunity to do so is when the chip is being transferred from one base to another in a secured truck. The truck can move on an infinite two-dimensional plane. Initially, it is located at some point with integer coordinates (H,K)(H,K)(H, K). Unfortunately, this point and the route the truck is going to follow are unknown. To accomplish his task, David Jones can use two kinds of weapons with the following feedback systems: Hellfire ― Launched towards a single point (X,Y)(X,Y)(X, Y). Anything lying at this point is instantly destroyed. Let's denote the location of the truck at this point in time by (A,B)(A,B)(A, B). Then, the feedback is one of the following strings: ""O"" if X=AX=AX = A and Y=BY=BY = B ""PY"" if X>AX>AX gt A and Y=BY=BY = B ""NY"" if X<AX<AX lt A and Y=BY=BY = B ""XP"" if X=AX=AX = A and Y>BY>BY gt B ""XN"" if X=AX=AX = A and Y<BY<BY lt B ""PP"" if X>AX>AX gt A and Y>BY>BY gt B ""PN"" if X>AX>AX gt A and Y<BY<BY lt B ""NP"" if X<AX<AX lt A and Y>BY>BY gt B ""NN"" if X<AX<AX lt A and Y<BY<BY lt B Ring of Fire ― Applied on a rectangular region with a bottom left corner (X1,Y1)(X1,Y1)(X_1, Y_1) and a top right corner (X2,Y2)(X2,Y2)(X_2, Y_2). Anything lying on the perimeter of the rectangle gets instantly destroyed. Let's denote the location of the truck at this point in time by (A,B)(A,B)(A, B). Then, the feedback is one of the following strings: ""O"" if (A,B)(A,B)(A, B) lies on the perimeter of the rectangle ""IN"" if (A,B)(A,B)(A, B) lies strictly inside the rectangle ""OUT"" if (A,B)(A,B)(A, B) lies outside the rectangle In addition, if an attack is unsuccessful, the truck moves exactly D units in one of the four possible axis-parallel directions, i.e. it moves from its current position (A,B)(A,B)(A, B) to (A+D,B)(A+D,B)(A+D, B) or (A,B+D)(A,B+D)(A, B+D) or (A−D,B)(A−D,B)(A-D, B) or (A,B−D)(A,B−D)(A, B-D) (not necessarily the same direction for all unsuccessful attacks). The value of D is fixed and known to be either 0 (the truck does not move) or 1. Each weapon may be used multiple times and they may be used in any order. However, since using the weapons is costly, you may only make up to Q attacks (with both types of weapons in total). Obviously, your task is to destroy the truck, i.e. to receive ""O"" as the feedback. Interaction First, you should read a line containing three space-separated integers T, Q and D. You should solve T test cases, each with the same parameters Q and D. The description of interaction for T test cases follows. For each test case, you may make up to Q queries. For each query: If you want to use a Hellfire attack, print a single line containing three space-separated integers 1, X and Y (−2⋅1018≤X,Y≤2⋅1018−2⋅1018≤X,Y≤2⋅1018-2 cdot 10^{18} leq X, Y leq 2cdot 10^{18}). If you want to use a Ring of Fire attack, print a single line containing five space-separated integers 2, X1X1X_1, Y1Y1Y_1, X2X2X_2 and Y2Y2Y_2 (−2⋅1018≤X1≤X2≤2⋅1018−2⋅1018≤X1≤X2≤2⋅1018-2 cdot 10^{18} leq X_1 leq X_2 leq 2 cdot 10^{18} and −2⋅1018≤Y1≤Y2≤2⋅1018−2⋅1018≤Y1≤Y2≤2⋅1018-2 cdot 10^{18} leq Y_1 leq Y_2 leq 2 cdot 10^{18}). Then, you should read a single line containing one string. If you ask an invalid query or exceed the query limit, this string is ""FAILED"" and you should immediately terminate your program to receive the Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, this string is the feedback for your attack. As soon as you receive feedback ""O"", you should stop making queries and continue solving the remaining test cases. Note: Some of the test files use a non-adaptive grader, while some use an adaptive grader, where the initial point and the route are not fixed at the start, but the answers to your queries are chosen in such a way that there is always at least one initial point (H,K)(H,K)(H,K) and sequence of moves which are consistent with all answers. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

During the interaction: The truck is initially located at (1,2)(1,2)(1, 2). The first attack is Hellfire at the point (0,0)(0,0)(0, 0). The attack is unsuccessful and the feedback is ""NN"". The truck moves to the point (2,2)(2,2)(2, 2). The second attack is Hellfire at the point (2,3)(2,3)(2, 3). The attack is unsuccessful and the feedback is ""XP"". The truck moves to the point (2,1)(2,1)(2, 1). The third attack is Ring of Fire at the perimeter of the rectangle with the bottom left corner (1,0)(1,0)(1, 0) and the top right corner (3,3)(3,3)(3, 3). Since the truck lies inside this rectangle, the attack is unsuccessful and the feedback is ""IN"". The truck moves to the point (3,1)(3,1)(3, 1). The fourth attack is Hellfire at the point (4,0)(4,0)(4, 0). The attack is unsuccessful and the feedback is ""PN"". The truck moves to the point (2,1)(2,1)(2, 1). The fifth attack is Hellfire at the point (−1,1)(−1,1)(-1, 1). The attack is unsuccessful and the feedback is ""NY"". The truck moves to the point (1,1)(1,1)(1, 1). The sixth attack is Ring of Fire at the perimeter of the rectangle with the bottom left corner (−2,1)(−2,1)(-2, 1) and the top right corner (2,2)(2,2)(2, 2). Since the truck lies on this perimeter, the attack is successful and the feedback is ""O"", since the truck with the EMP chip is destroyed.

Mean equals Median ,"Chef gets confused between mean and median very often, and as a result, he has developed a dislike of arrays whose mean and median are not equal. Chef has an array A of N elements. He can perform the following operation on it: Pick an index 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N1 leq i leq N and increase AiAiA_i by 1. He would like to obtain an array whose mean and median are equal. Determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve this. Note: The median of an array A of length N is defined as follows: Sort the array A. Then, If N is even, the median is the (N2)th(N2)th(frac{N}{2})^{text{th}} element If N is odd, the median is the (N+12)th(N+12)th(frac{N + 1}{2})^{text{th}} element For example, the median of the array [3,4,1,2][3,4,1,2][3,4,1,2] is 2 and the median of the array [3,4,1][3,4,1][3,4,1] is 3.

Physics Class ,"The Physics teacher in Tanu's class is teaching concepts of a bouncing ball. The rubber ball that she is using has the property that if the ball is dropped from height H then, it bounces back to maximum height H/F. So after first bounce it rises up to maximum height H/F, after second bounce to maximum height H/F2, after third bounce to maximum height H/F3, and so on. The class has N children, and the teacher wants to select two children such that when the taller child drops the ball from his height, ball reaches a maximum height equal to the height of the shorter child after some (possibly zero) number of bounces. Note that zero bounces mean heights of the two children will be same. Given the heights of the children in the class Height[i], can you tell how many ways are there for the teacher to select two children for the demonstration? Note that when heights are same, the pair is only counted once (See first example for further clarification).

Tug of War ,"""Stick with the strongest team, that's the only way."" Gi-Hun and his mates have survived the deadly night, but now it’s time for the tug of war. The game proceeds as follows: Two teams have to face off against each other in a tug of war match. The match proceeds in a series of rounds as follows: Initially, one player from each team will come forward to play. The one who wins the round will stay in, while the loser is eliminated. If the round is a draw, both players are eliminated. When a member of a team is eliminated, that team then sends another person to play in the next round. This process continues as long as both teams have at least one player left. Note that if a player wins their round, they must stay in for the next round — they cannot be replaced by another player. A team is said to win the match if it has at least 1 player remaining, while all players of the opponent's team are eliminated. If both teams have no players left, the match is said to be a draw. Gi-Hun has to come up with a strategy for his team to win the game. He saw the opponent queue of N players, where their ithithi^{text{th}} player has strength AiAiA_i. He also knows that the opponent will send the players in the same order as they appear in A. Formally for any two players i and j where i<ji<ji<j, player i will always play before player j. He also knows the strength of his M players — the ithithi^{text{th}} player of his team has strength BiBiB_i. Further, Gi-Hun knows that when two players play against each other, the player with higher strength always wins. If both players have equal strength, the round is a draw. Now, he wants to know whether they can win a match or not, and if they can, what is the ordering of his team players that will let them win. In case multiple orderings are possible, he would like to know the lexicographically smallest ordering. An array X is lexicographically smaller than an array Y if there exists an index i such that XiXiX_i < YiYiY_i, and Xj=YjXj=YjX_j=Y_j for all 1≤j<i1≤j<i1 leq j lt i. Less formally, at the first index i in which they differ, XiXiX_i < YiYiY_i.

The Gift Of Raksha Bandhan ,"Its time of Raksha Bandhan so its compulsory for every brother to give a gift to his sister. Brother Jon is planning to give a string S of length L to his sister Arya. After receiving the gift from her brother, Arya decided to share the string with her brother Jon. String S contains characters from index 0 to index L - 1. She will select a pivot called P ie any index P(1 ≤ P ≤ L - 1) and divides the original string into two parts. First part will contain characters from index 0 to index P - 1 and second part will contain characters from index P to L - 1. Jon will keep the first part and Arya will keep the second part. Arya is great fan of LCP (Longest Common Prefix) so she decided that she will select such an index as pivot such that LCP of the two part is high. Though she like LCP but she does not know how to calculate it. Help her to solve the problem. Arya will ask you Q questions. Each question is represented by a index P and you have to answer the LCP (Longest Common Prefix) of the two parts.

Guessing Game ,"This is an interactive problem. Incase you are new to interactive problems, take a look at this link. Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a hidden integer x; Bob only knows an integer N such that 1≤x≤N1≤x≤N1 le x le N and he has to find x by asking questions. In each question, Bob must choose an integer y (1≤y≤N1≤y≤N1 le y le N), and Alice answers 'G', 'L' or 'E' based on whether x>yx>yx gt y, x<yx<yx lt y or x=yx=yx = y respectively. However, to make things more interesting, they decided that Alice can lie sometimes. In particular, she cannot lie two times in a row and when x=yx=yx = y (i.e. Bob found x), she has to answer 'E', so lying corresponds to answering 'G' when the correct answer is 'L' or vice versa. Alice can choose to lie at any time as long as she follows these rules. As soon as Alice answers 'E' to some question, the game ends and Bob wins. Help Bob and win the game using no more than K questions. Note: The grader is adaptive ― the answer is not fixed at the start, but the answers to your questions are chosen in such a way that there is always at least one integer x which is consistent with all answers (for some valid choice of answers that are lies). Interaction First, you should read a line containing a single integer N. Then, you should ask questions. To ask a question, print a line containing a single integer y. Then, you must read a line containing a single character: 'G', 'L' or 'E', denoting the answer to your question. As soon as the answer to one of your questions is 'E', you must terminate your program.

Flappy Bird ,"Chef is playing a noob version of the game with the following rules: The bird starts at a height H at x=0x=0x = 0. There are N obstacles (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the i-th obstacle is at a position xixix_i and it has a height hihih_i. For each integer i (0≤i<xN0≤i<xN0 le i lt x_N), Chef has the option to click once when the bird is at x=ix=ix = i. Let's denote the bird's height (y-coordinate) at that point by j. If he clicks, the bird moves to x=i+1x=i+1x = i+1 and y=j+1y=j+1y = j+1. Otherwise, the bird moves to x=i+1x=i+1x = i+1 and y=j−1y=j−1y = j-1. There is no ceiling and all the obstacles extend upwards from the bottom and not the other way around. For each valid i, the bird crosses the i-th obstacle successfully if the bird's height at x=xix=xix = x_i is strictly greater than hihih_i. At any point before x=xNx=xNx = x_N, the bird's height should remain non-negative, otherwise it will drown. If the bird crosses the N-th obstacle successfully, Chef wins the game.

Influence on Social media ,"Recently social media has been flooded by fb posts, tweets, news articles about only thing - demonetization. A great debate is ongoing over it. Most of the people discussing in social media platform usually tend to take sides, i.e. either they support the move, or they not. There is such a group of N people, who vehemently discuss about their views about this everywhere possible on any platform. The influence of a person is determined by the number of posts he makes. The more posts you make about your support/opposition, more your influence. Usually it is hard to determine whether a person supports/opposes the moves just by reading their posts, as they will make some oblique references here and there, often followed by a big digression into cat-dog memes, and name calling as the final resort, sometimes as a first resort too in rare cases. But you came to know from FB AI team that the people whose support this move behave slightly oddly. Specifically, FB team told that a person will be a supporter if number of divisors of the number of posts a person makes is an odd prime number. You are given information about number of posts each person makes, specifically person i makes Pi posts. A study about user behavior tells that no-one likes to have same number of posts as the other persons as they consider it as a loss of their identity. So, users make posts in such a way that no two persons have the same number of posts, i.e., all the Pi's are distinct. You want to study the social media strength of users supporting the move. Let K denote the number of supporters of the move. For each i-th most influential supporter, you want to find his/her rank in overall influence in the social media (considering both supporters/opposers).

Offer for Chef ,"Chef is very happy today because he got an offer from Gordon Ramsay himself to work for him in London. Chef wants to prepare a delicious cake for Gordon to impress him, but he does not know that Gordon Ramsay is not easy to impress. Gordon cut Chef's cake into N small slices (numbered 1 through N), placed in a row in such a way that for each valid i, slices i and i+1i+1i+1 are adjacent. Note that slices N and 1 are not adjacent. For each valid i, the i-th slice has taste AiAiA_i. Gordon wants to put special toppings on some slices and then ask Chef to group all slices into K clusters in such a way that the slices in each cluster form a contiguous sequence and the sweetness of the cake is maximum possible. For each valid i, let's denote the topping on the i-th slice by titit_i (ti=0ti=0t_i = 0 if there is no topping on this slice); the sweetness of this slice is ti⋅Aiti⋅Ait_i cdot A_i, so the sweetness of a slice without any special topping is 0. The sweetness of a cluster is the total (summed up) sweetness of all slices in this cluster. Let's denote the sweetnesses of all clusters by S1,S2,…,SKS1,S2,…,SKS_1, S_2, ldots, S_K. The sweetness of the whole cake is computed as S1∗S2∗…∗SKS1∗S2∗…∗SKS_1 * S_2 * ldots * S_K, where the operation ∗∗* is defined in the following way: for any non-negative integers x and y such that x≥yx≥yx ge y, x∗y=y∗x=∑n=0⌊log2(x)⌋2n(⌊x2n⌋mod2)(⌊y2n⌋mod2).x∗y=y∗x=∑n=0⌊log2⁡(x)⌋2n(⌊x2n⌋mod2)(⌊y2n⌋mod2).x * y = y * x = sum_{n=0}^{lfloorlog_2(x)rfloor} 2^nleft(leftlfloorfrac{x}{2^n}rightrfloor bmod 2right)left(leftlfloorfrac{y}{2^n}rightrfloor bmod 2right) ,. It can be proven that this operation is associative, i.e. (x∗y)∗z=x∗(y∗z)(x∗y)∗z=x∗(y∗z)(x * y) * z = x * (y * z). You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given the toppings on all slices and the number of clusters K. Tell Chef the maximum possible sweetness of the cake!

There is a hidden array of N integers, where the elements are numbered from A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,ANA_1, A_2, dots, A_N. Your task is to guess any array which is equivalent to the hidden array by asking the following query at most Q times. The elements of the guessed array must be within the range [1,109][1,109][1,10^{9}]. In each query, you give a subset of indices {i1,i2,…,ik}{i1,i2,…,ik}{i_1,i_2,dots,i_k} in the array i.e some subset of {1,2,…,N}{1,2,…,N}{1,2,dots,N} and the judge returns the frequency of most frequent element among {Ai1,Ai2,…,Aik}{Ai1,Ai2,…,Aik}{A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, dots, A_{i_k}}. Note that the indices must be distinct and the order doesn't matter. For example, consider the array [10,3,1,10,1,1,3][10,3,1,10,1,1,3][10,3,1,10,1,1,3]. The ouput of query {2,3,4,7}{2,3,4,7}{2,3,4,7} is 2. (3 occurs maximum number of times i.e 2 times) Ouput of query {2,3,1,4,5}{2,3,1,4,5}{2,3,1,4,5} is 2. (Both 1 and 101010 occur 2 times) Interaction First, you should read the number of test cases T. For each test case, you should read two integers N and Q. Then you may ask questions: Output ? followed by an integer denoting the number of elements in subset followed by the indices ?ki1i2…ik?ki1i2…ik? k i_1 i_2 dots i_k. Read an integer x denoting the answer to your query. If the query was invalid or you have exceeded the query limit, judge prints '-1' and exits with wrong answer verdict. In this case, you must also terminate your program. When you have determined the answer, print the character ! followed by N space-separated integers denoting the array !A1A2…AN!A1A2…AN! A_1 A_2 dots A_N. Note that this does not count towards a query. Now you must read an integer denoting that your answer is correct or not. If your answer is correct, judge prints '1'. In this case, you should continue solving the remaining test cases. If your answer is incorrect, judge prints '-1' and exits with wrong answer verdict. You must also terminate your program in this case otherwise, you may receive any verdict.

Water Transfer ,"The city of Hunterland can be represented as a grid with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M). Let's denote a cell in row r and column c by (r,c)(r,c)(r,c). Ahmet, the mayor, plans to develop the underground water system of Hunterland. There is a large reservoir of water in the cell (1,1)(1,1)(1, 1). Water from the reservoir must reach the cell (N,M)(N,M)(N, M) through a simple path in a network of underground pipes. From each cell (i,j)(i,j)(i,j), water flows out through a one-directional pipe with a given capacity ai,jai,ja_{i,j} and direction di,jdi,jd_{i,j} (up, down, left or right), either to a side-adjacent cell or out of the grid. At any moment, a pipe cannot hold more water than its capacity. Each cell, however, can receive water from any number of adjacent cells; in particular, there can be pairs of cells which send water directly to each other through two pipes with opposite directions. Due to poor planning of the previous mayor, the N⋅MN⋅MN cdot M pipes do not have optimal capacities or directions. Ahmet employs Faruk the engineer to rectify this network. Faruk does not have much time, so he may only perform up to K operations. In each operation, he should: choose some outgoing pipe with positive capacity decrease its capacity by 1 rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, i.e. change its direction in one of the following ways: up to right, right to down, down to left or left to up Faruk's goal is to maximise the amount of water that can be sent from the cell (1,1)(1,1)(1,1) to the cell (N,M)(N,M)(N,M) per unit of time. Specifically, for each simple path along pipes from the cell (1,1)(1,1)(1, 1) to (N,M)(N,M)(N, M) in the final network, consider the minimum of capacities of pipes in this path; the amount of water that can be sent from (1,1)(1,1)(1, 1) to (N,M)(N,M)(N, M) per unit of time is the maximum of these minimum values, or 0 if there is no valid path. Help Faruk determine this maximum possible amount of water that can be sent from the cell (1,1)(1,1)(1,1) to the cell (N,M)(N,M)(N,M). Note that it is not required to minimise the number of clockwise rotations. Also note that the capacity and direction of the pipe from the cell (N,M)(N,M)(N, M) do not affect the answer, but have been given on the input for uniformity.

Rocky likes to watch as many stars as possible. So, he got an idea and made a slider for the base of the stand. But the slider was too slippery, so you have to fix the telescope to view through it. Given N stars and their coordinates on the horizontal line of vision of the telescope, can you help Rocky find the position to fix the telescope such that he can watch maximum number of stars?

Interactive Tree ,"This problem is similar to the problem ""INTREECTIVE2"". The only difference between them is the number of queries allowed — in this problem, up to 21 queries can be made. In Div. 1 and Div. 2 this problem is worth 40 points and ""INTREECTIVE2"" is worth 60. In Div. 3 this problem is non-scorable. This is an interactive task You are given a tree consisting of N nodes, numbered from 1 to N. Chef selected an arbitrary node and marked it. Chef gave you a judge to play with, using which you can ask queries about the given tree. In each query, you give the judge a non-empty set S of nodes. The judge returns 1 if there exists u and v (not necessarily distinct) such that u,v∈Su,v∈Su,v in S and the marked node lies on the shortest path from u to v, or 0 otherwise. You have to find the marked node. For each test case, you can use at most 21 queries. Interaction Begin the interaction by reading a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for T test cases follows. For each test case, first read a single integer N, denoting the number of nodes in the tree. N−1N−1N - 1 lines follow. The ithithi^{th} of these lines contains two space-separated integers uiuiu_i and viviv_i, denoting an edge between the nodes uiuiu_i and viviv_i. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree. Now you may begin asking queries. To ask a query about a set S of k nodes v1,v2,…,vkv1,v2,…,vkv_{1},v_{2},…,v_{k} (1≤k≤N,1≤vi≤N,1≤k≤N,1≤vi≤N,1 le k le N, 1 le v_{i} le N, all viviv_{i} are distinct), output: ? k v1v1v_{1} v2v2v_{2} ……ldots vkvkv_{k} You will then receive an integer x. x is 1 if there exists u and v(not necessarily distinct) such that u,v∈Su,v∈Su,v in S and the marked node lies on the path from u to v, or 0 otherwise. When you have found the marked node(say v), print the answer in the following format: ! v Outputting the answer doesn't count towards the limit of 212121 queries. If at any time you make an invalid query or exceed the query limit, the interaction is terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict. If you receive a Judge Error verdict, that means your program actually has one of many possible errors: an Idleness Limit Exceeded error (it is waiting for input that does not exist), a Runtime error, you asked an invalid query, or possibly some other error.

The Dirty Path ,"Bob is currently at origin. Bob walks on X-axis and towards the right. In one move, Bob can either jump 1 unit to the right or 2 units to the right. Some of these coordinates are dirty. Bob wants to know the number of ways going to (Y,0)(Y,0)(Y, 0) from (0,0)(0,0)(0, 0). Two ways are considered to be different if there exists an integer j such that the location of Bob after j steps is different. Sounds like a well known problem? Bob quickly came up with a perfect solution. A valid path should contain '.' which represents a clean coordinate or '#' which represents a dirty coordinate. If the length of the path is LENLENLEN, then Bob's program calculates and prints number of ways to reach (LEN−1,0)(LEN−1,0)(LEN-1, 0) from (0,0)(0,0)(0, 0). An integer X is considered to be a good integer if Bob's program prints X for some valid path. You have to write a program to output Y, where Y is NthNthN^{th} good number in the range L to R. You should also print the valid path that would make Bob's program output Y. If there are multiple valid paths, you can output any of them. Please see the output section for more details.

Now, after some time, Malvika realized that creating hard problems for a contest is not as easy for her as solving them. So she asked her friend Animesh to join the team and help her with it. Animesh himself is no good with creating problems, but he suggested her a clever strategy to reduce the number of hard problems she needs to create.

For each valid i, the i-th frog is initially at the position i, it has weight WiWiW_i, and whenever you hit its back, it jumps a distance LiLiL_i to the right, i.e. its position increases by LiLiL_i. The weights of the frogs are pairwise distinct. You can hit the back of each frog any number of times (possibly zero, not necessarily the same for all frogs) in any order. The frogs do not intefere with each other, so there can be any number of frogs at the same time at each position. Your task is to sort the frogs in the increasing order of weight using the smallest possible number of hits. In other words, after all the hits are performed, then for each pair of frogs (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) such that Wi<WjWi<WjW_i lt W_j, the position of the i-th frog should be strictly smaller than the position of the j-th frog.

Swapping Chefs Way ,"Chef is working on his swap-based sorting algorithm for strings. Given a string S of length N, he wants to know whether he can sort the string using his algorithm. According to the algorithm, one can perform the following operation on string S any number of times: Choose some index i (1≤i≤N)(1≤i≤N)(1 leq i leq N) and swap the ithithi^{th} character from the front and the ithithi^{th} character from the back. More formally, choose an index i and swap SiSiS_i and S(N+1−i)S(N+1−i)S_{(N+1-i)}. For example, d––cba––d_cba_underline{text{d}} text{cb} underline{text{a}} can be converted to a––cbd––a_cbd_underline{text{a}} text{cb} underline{text{d}} using one operation where i=1i=1i = 1.

Mighty Friend ,"Motu and Tomu are very good friends who are always looking for new games to play against each other and ways to win these games. One day, they decided to play a new type of game with the following rules: The game is played on a sequence A0,A1,…,AN−1A0,A1,…,AN−1A_0, A_1, dots, A_{N-1}. The players alternate turns; Motu plays first, since he's earlier in lexicographical order. Each player has a score. The initial scores of both players are 0. On his turn, the current player has to pick the element of A with the lowest index, add its value to his score and delete that element from the sequence A. At the end of the game (when A is empty), Tomu wins if he has strictly greater score than Motu. Otherwise, Motu wins the game. In other words, Motu starts by selecting A0A0A_0, adding it to his score and then deleting it; then, Tomu selects A1A1A_1, adds its value to his score and deletes it, and so on. Motu and Tomu already chose a sequence A for this game. However, since Tomu plays second, he is given a different advantage: before the game, he is allowed to perform at most K swaps in A; afterwards, the two friends are going to play the game on this modified sequence. Now, Tomu wants you to determine if it is possible to perform up to K swaps in such a way that he can win this game. Tags: Maps Data Structures ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/MTYFRI,CC

The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows: Let's denote the score of the k-th subtask of this problem by SCkSCkSC_k and the number of contestants who solved it by NSkNSkNS_k. Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score. Calculate the number n of valid indices k such that NSk>NSk+1NSk>NSk+1NS_k > NS_{k + 1}. For problem i, the difficulty is a pair of integers (n,i)(n,i)(n, i). You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels.

Capital Movement ,"Chef is playing a video game. In a video game, there's a advanced civilization that has a total of N planets under control. All of those planets are connected with N-1 teleports in such a way, that it's possible to travel between any two planets using those teleports. There's a chance that some planet gets infected. In this case it takes 24 hours for civilization to find out infection and prevent it from spreading. During this time infection uses teleport one time and infect all the planets that can be achieved in one teleport jump. So, once infection is detected at planet V, scientists already know that all planets connected to V via teleport are also infected. All the neccessary teleports are disabled right away and medics start working on eliminating the infection. Each planet has population. Planets are numbered from 1 to N and their populations are P1, P2, ., PN. It is known that all the Pi are distinct. There's a capital among all those planets. The capital is known to have the biggest population. Once infection is detected at planet V, after disabling teleports on planet V and all connected to them, government has to establish a new capital if needed in the remaining not-infected planets. So, they list all the planets that are not connected to V and are not V. Then they pick the planet with biggest population. Your task is to find the number of this planet for every possible V.

Team Split ,"Chef wants to split a team of new chef into two teams to play a game. In order to make the split, he first designates two team captains who take alternate turns selecting players for their teams. During each turn, the captain selects a single player for his team. Since each captain wants to make the strongest possible team, he will always select the best available player. The players have strengths as integer number, where higher strength indicate better players. After all the players have been selected, the team strength is computed as the sum of the strengths of the players on that team. For example, if strengths of 5 players are 5,7,8,4 and 2, then the first captain selects the player with strength 8 for his team, the second captain gets the player with strength 7, the first gets the one with strength 5, the second the one with strength 4, and the last one (strength 2) goes to the first team. The first team now has a total strength 8+5+2=15, and the second team has strength 7+4=11. Now Chef wants to find the absolute strength difference between the two teams. For the example above the answer is 4(=|15-11|). But Chef does not know exact strengths of each player. He knows some parameter a, b, c and d and a formula to find the strength of each player. The formula is S0 = d, Si = (a * Si-12 + b * Si-1 + c) mod 100, for i = 1 to N - 1 There are N players numbering 0 to N-1 and Si is the strength of player i.

Quentin Tarantino ,"is a famous Hollywood filmmaker and actor. His films have a unique characteristic of connecting with youth by using popular culture references. They are usually divided into various sub-parts denoted by chapters. His plot of stories is never linear, he always make sure that the chapters should never be shown in the order of Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, ,.. Chapter n linearly. He believes doing this an insult to the intelligence of viewers. For example, Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3 can never be a chapter sequence in Tarantino's movies.. He can have a sequence of Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 1 instead. Recently Santa gifted Tom a movie which consists of n chapters. This movie can possibly be directed by your favorite Tarantino or by someone else. Directors in hollywood can sometimes be very sloppy, they sometimes drop some chapters too and stupid they are that they will leave numbering of the chapters as it is and one can easily identify the chapters that were dropped. For example, if you find the sequence of chapters as - chapter 1, chapter 5, chapter 3, don't be surprised, they did not even take burden of renumbering the chapters to chapter 1, chapter 3, chapter 2. They can sometimes repeat the chapter numbers too. Remember that Tarantino is not a sloppy director, so he never makes this kind of stupid mistakes. Tom happened to find the sequence of chapters in the movie, this sequence contains n chapters, i-th of which is denoted by chapteri. Tom is a big fan of movies of Tarantino.

01 Subsequence ,"You are handed a binary string S, but not in any ordinary form. Instead of being directly given the value of S, you are given an array C of size N representing the 01-compression representation of S. This means S first contains C1C1C_1 00text{0} characters, then C2C2C_2 11text{1} characters, then C3C3C_3 00text{0} characters, and so on. For example, the array C=[2,3,4,3]C=[2,3,4,3]C = [2, 3, 4, 3] corresponds with the binary string 001001001001text{001001}. You are allowed to modify S by swapping elements of C. More specifically, you are allowed to swap CiCiC_i and CjCjC_j as long as CiCiC_i and CjCjC_j both encodes blocks of the same character. For example, from C=[2,3,4,3]C=[2,3,4,3]C = [2, 3, 4, 3], you can swap C1C1C_1 and C3C3C_3 because both of them encode blocks of 00text{0}'s, turning C to [4,3,2,3][4,3,2,3][4, 3, 2, 3] and S to 001001001001text{001001}. However, you cannot swap C1C1C_1 and C2C2C_2 because C1C1C_1 encodes a block of 00text{0}'s, while C2C2C_2 encodes a block of 11text{1}s. Perform the swapping operation in any way as many times as you want (including zero times) so that the final string S has as many 0101text{01} subsequences as possible. As a reminder, a subsequence of a string is a sequence that can be derived by deleting zero or more characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. You need to find any optimal final array C, for which the number of 0101text{01} subsequence will be the largest possible.

To see the progress of the players, he noted their rating changes at the end of each month. After the tournament, FIDE asked Chef to find the number of players whose peak rating and peak ranking did not occur in the same month. In other words, Chef was asked to find the ratings and ranking of each player after each of the M months. Then, using this data, he should find the number of players, such that the month in which they achieved their highest rating over all the months, was different from the month in which they achieved their best rank (based on ratings), over all the months. Note that we do not consider the initial rating/ranking, but only the rating and rankings after each of the M months. For a particular player, if there are multiple peak rating or peak ranking months, Chef was to consider the earliest of them. If multiple players had the same rating at the end of some month, they were to be given the same rank.

Stack-Queue Sort (Challenge) ,"There are B blocks (numbered 1 through B) distributed in N containers (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the weight of the i-th block is WiWiW_i kilograms. For each container i, you should decide if it will be used like a stack or a queue. At any time, a container may contain any sequence of blocks (possibly the empty sequence); let's denote the number of the j-th block (indexed from 1) in the i-th container by Ai,jAi,jA_{i,j}. A stack is a data structure that stores a sequence of integers (X1,X2,…,XM)(X1,X2,…,XM)(X_1, X_2, ldots, X_M) and supports two types of instructions: pop: Remove the last element of the sequence. After this instruction, the sequence becomes (X1,…,XM−1)(X1,…,XM−1)(X_1, ldots, X_{M-1}); it must be non-empty before this instruction. The return value of this instruction is XMXMX_M. push a: Add an element a at the end of the sequence. After this instruction, the sequence becomes (X1,…,XM,a)(X1,…,XM,a)(X_1, ldots, X_M, a). Similarly, a queue is a data structure that stores a sequence of integers (X1,X2,…,XM)(X1,X2,…,XM)(X_1, X_2, ldots, X_M) and supports two types of instructions: pop: Remove the first element of the sequence. After this instruction, the sequence becomes (X2,…,XM)(X2,…,XM)(X_2, ldots, X_M); it must be non-empty before this instruction. The return value of this instruction is X1X1X_1. push a: Add an element a at the end of the sequence. After this instruction, the sequence becomes (X1,…,XM,a)(X1,…,XM,a)(X_1, ldots, X_M, a). For each valid i, it takes Ci⋅wCi⋅wC_i cdot w nanoseconds to pop a block with weight w from the container i and Di⋅wDi⋅wD_i cdot w nanoseconds to push a block with weight w to the container i. Using the given data structures, you may perform the following operation at most B2/2B2/2B^2/2 times: choose two containers c1c1c_1 and c2c2c_2 (c1≠c2c1≠c2c_1 neq c_2), pop a block from the c1c1c_1-th container and then push this block to the c2c2c_2-th container. Your task is to sort all the blocks in a single container, i.e. after performing all operations, the sequence of blocks in some container must be (1,2,…,B)(1,2,…,B)(1, 2, ldots, B). The time spent performing operations should be as small as possible. Tags: alei, heuristic, jan21, sorting, tie-breaker ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/SQSORT,CC

The person with the smallest unique number (that is, the smallest number that was not said by anybody else) wins. Sometimes, there is a case when there are no unique numbers at all. Then the game is obviously a draw, so nobody wins it. Sometimes, it's hard to determine the winner, especially, when the number of players is enormous.

Game with numbers ,"Chef is playing a game with his brother Chefu. Before the game begins, C cards are placed on a table. Each card has a number written on it; since C can be very large, these numbers are described by two sequences A and D. Each of these sequences has length N; for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ N), Di cards, each with number Ai written on it, are placed on the table. Therefore, C is equal to the sum of elements of D. Note that the elements of A don't have to be unique. You are also given a sequence B with length K. The game will last for exactly K rounds numbered 1 through K. The players alternate turns — Chef plays on odd-numbered turns and his brother on even-numbered turns. In the i-th round, the current player must select Bi cards currently lying on the table, keep these cards on the table and discard all other cards. Chef's goal is to maximize the sum of numbers written on cards that remain on the table after the last round, while Chefu's goal is minimize this sum.

Snake Procession ,"The annual snake festival is upon us, and all the snakes of the kingdom have gathered to participate in the procession. Chef has been tasked with reporting on the procession, and for this he decides to first keep track of all the snakes. When he sees a snake first, it'll be its Head, and hence he will mark a 'H'. The snakes are long, and when he sees the snake finally slither away, he'll mark a 'T' to denote its tail. In the time in between, when the snake is moving past him, or the time between one snake and the next snake, he marks with '.'s. Because the snakes come in a procession, and one by one, a valid report would be something like ""..H..T…HTH….T."", or ""…"", or ""HT"", whereas ""T…H..H.T"", ""H..T..H"", ""H..H..T..T"" would be invalid reports (See explanations at the bottom). Formally, a snake is represented by a 'H' followed by some (possibly zero) '.'s, and then a 'T'. A valid report is one such that it begins with a (possibly zero length) string of '.'s, and then some (possibly zero) snakes between which there can be some '.'s, and then finally ends with some (possibly zero) '.'s. Chef had binged on the festival food and had been very drowsy. So his report might be invalid. You need to help him find out if his report is valid or not.

Formally, a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. So in a string ""abcdef"", ""abc"" is a substring whereas ""adf"" is not a substring. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. madam or mom. Tags: arnie8991, cakewalk, encd2020, strings ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/ECAPR201,CC
Table Game ,"Alice and Bob are playing a game with a (N+1)×(M+1)(N+1)×(M+1)(N+1)times (M+1) table. Let's denote the cell in the i-th row and j-th column (0≤i≤N0≤i≤N0 le i le N, 0≤j≤M0≤j≤M0 le j le M) by (i,j)(i,j)(i, j). The rules of the game are: At the beginning, a stone is placed in some cell of the table. The players alternate turns, Alice goes first. In each turn, the current player must move the stone from its current cell (let's denote it by (x,y)(x,y)(x, y)) to the cell (x−1,y)(x−1,y)(x-1, y) or to the cell (x,y−1)(x,y−1)(x, y-1). As soon as the stone is placed in a cell (x,y)(x,y)(x, y) with x=0x=0x=0 or y=0y=0y=0, the game ends. The winner of the game is determined by the cell the stone ended up in and the player who moved it there; you are given this information for all possible terminal cells on the input. (Note that the stone never reaches the cell (0,0)(0,0)(0, 0).) You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given the initial position (x,y)(x,y)(x, y) of the stone, and you should determine the winner of the game.

Mountain Holidays ,"Some time ago, Chef discovered that more and more people have started climbing mountains every day. So he decided to build restaurant in the Ukrainian resort Bukovel (Carpathian Mountains). But there are many places to choose, so he wants to choose the best one. Let us learn how attractiveness for a location is calculated. Next to every place, is some mountain. A Mountain is a sequence of points (0,height0), (1,height1), . (n-1,heightn-1), where every two adjacent points are connected with a segment. For example, consider the mountain (0,0), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), (4,1), (5,3), (6,0), (7,1), (8,0) / ///  / / Visitors may start their climbing from some position i and finish in position j, where (i < j).They calculate the attractiveness of a mountain, as the number of different climbs that it offers. Of course, so does our Chef! A climb from position i to position j is the sequence (i,heighti), . (j,heightj).Two climbs, say i1 to j1 and i2 to j2, are different if and only if (j1 – i1 != j2 – i2) orheighti1+k – heighti1+k-1 != heighti2+k – heighti2+k–1 for at least some k in the range (1, 2, . j1-i1). Let us consider two climbs from the mountain we considered above // / and / /   The first one is the climb from (0 to 3), and the second one is the climb from (4 to 6). They are different because (3 - 0 != 6 - 4). On the other hand, climbs such as (0 to 1) and (4 to 5) are the same. Given the array, heights, find the number of different climbs that exist on the mountain which is described by the sequence of these heights. Because answer can be very large, output it modulo 1,0,0,009.

Sed Passwords ,"The notorious hacker group ""Sed"" managed to obtain a string S from their secret sources. The string contains only lowercase English letters along with the character '?'. A substring of S is a contiguous subsequence of that string. For example, the string ""chef"" is a substring of the string ""codechef"", but the string ""codeh"" is not a substring of ""codechef"". A substring of S is good if it is possible to choose a lowercase English letter C such that the following process succeeds: Create a string R, which is a copy of the substring, but with each '?' replaced by the letter c. Note that all occurrences of '?' must be replaced by the same letter. For each lowercase English letter: Compute the number of times it occurs in S and the number of times it occurs in R; let's denote them by A and B respectively. The '?' characters in the original string S are ignored when computing A. Check the parity of A and B. If they do not have the same parity, i.e. one of them is even while the other is odd, then this process fails. If the parities of the number of occurrences in S and R are the same for each letter, the process succeeds. For different substrings, we may choose different values of C.

Level Of Difference ,"How to measure the difference between two strings? This is a midnight question of biological scientists. The number of pairs of different characters in the same position may be a good indicator. However, it will not work well in the case when two strings have different lengths. The longest common subsequence will also fail when strings are too long. Recently, Professor of Math L.P.C. has invented the special method to deal with this problem. His invention has been known as a simple but creative solution: the difference is based on the number of substrings (a non-empty group of consecutive characters) of one string that are not substrings of the other string. Let's learn about his invention. Call the first string as A and the second string as B. Let S be the set of all different substrings of A, and T be the set of all different substrings of B. We then define another set P which consists of all the strings that belongs to S or T, but not both. According to the Professor L.P.C. method, the size of P is a good indicator to measure the difference between A and B. For example, let A = aacd and B = cdaa. We can see that: S = {a, aa, aac, aacd, ac, acd, c, cd, d}, T = {c, cd, cda, cdaa, d, da, daa, a, aa}, P = {aac, aacd, ac, acd, cda, cdaa, da, daa}. Size of P is 8 and we can say the level of difference between A and B is 8. Your task is to find this indicator.

(If the number of digits is odd, then the middle digit is ignored while considering the first and second halves) Mirror Order: The first digit of the first half is a mirror image of the last digit of the second half. Similarly, the second digit of the first half is a mirror image of the second last digit of the second half, and so on.

Such as the student whose roll number is 1 used “a” instead of “p” in the sentence “pore gelo” and said “aore gelo”. similarly the student whose roll is 11, will say “kore gelo”. And the students also like uniqueness. So none of the words will be repeated by anybody. Father Proshanto sir, was passing by the class, heard student’s making noise. He seized some student and he heard what they are saying. But they are not telling their roll number when they were asked. Can you help father Proshanto sir to get their roll number? N. B. May one of the student repeat sir’s dialogue bt none of them will repeat any other student’s dialogue. N.B. the student with the roll 53 will say “baore gelo” .

Willows Sort ,"Willow, a 3 years old genius, thought that sorting is based on the last digit of a number. His comparison process is if the last digit of an integer A is smaller than the last digit of another integer B ,then A<B. And if the last digit of two integers is same then he checks the previous one and this way the comparison continues. That means, if the digits of an integer A is represented as a1a1a_1,a2a2a_2…anana_n and another integer B as b1b1b_1,b2b2b_2…bmbmb_m (n and m not necessary to be equal), A will be smaller than B if there is an i such that AiAiA_i < BiBiB_i and for each valid j > i, AjAjA_j = BjBjB_j. For example, If A=123A=123A=123 , B=521B=521B=521 then A > B. If A = 521521521 , B = 518518518 then A < B Willow is trying to sort N numbers in ascending order in his process. Can you help him?

Chef agreed but as he asked Alex to give him an example so that he can understand how to decrypt it. Alex gave him an example which chef analyzed and found that the encryption of the text was done by an algorithm according to which - Replacing letters 'a'-'m' with 'n'-'z' Replacing letters 'n'-'z' with 'a'-'m' Replacing letters 'A'-'M' with 'N'-'Z' Replacing letters 'N'-'Z' with 'A'-'M' Also, replacing digits '0'-'4' with '5'-'9' and replacing digits '5'-'9' with '0'-'4' will give him the desired output.

Exponential Sub-Palindromes ,"You are given a binary string S of N bits. The bits in the string are indexed starting from 1. S[i] denotes the ith bit of S. Let's say that a sequence i1, i2, …, iK(1 ≤ K; 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < … < iK ≤ N) produces a palindrome when applied to S, if the string S[i1] S[i2] … S[ik] is a palindrome (that is, reads the same backward or forward). In addition, a sequence i1, i2, …, iK(1 ≤ K; 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < … < iK ≤ N) is said to be exponential, if ij + 1 = p * ij for each integer 1 ≤ j < K and for some integer p > 1.

Chef and Strings ,"Having already mastered cooking, Chef has now decided to learn how to play the guitar. Often while trying to play a song, Chef has to skip several strings to reach the string he has to pluck. Eg. he may have to pluck the 1st1st1^{st} string and then the 6th6th6^{th} string. This is easy in guitars with only 6 strings; However, Chef is playing a guitar with 10610610^6 strings. In order to simplify his task, Chef wants you to write a program that will tell him the total number of strings he has to skip while playing his favourite song. This is how guitar strings are numbered (In ascending order from right to left). Eg. to switch from string 1 to 6, Chef would have to skip 4 strings (2,3,4,5)(2,3,4,5)(2, 3, 4, 5).

Chef and Glove ,"Winter has finally come to Chefland, so Chef bought a glove for herself. Chef has a hand with N fingers (for the sake of simplicity, let us consider the thumb a finger too) numbered 1 through N and the glove has N sheaths numbered 1 through N. Exactly one finger has to be inserted into each sheath. You are given the lengths of Chef's fingers, as seen from left to right. You are also given the lengths of the sheaths of the glove, from left to right, as seen from the front. Chef can wear the glove normally (the front side of the glove matching the front of Chef's hand), or she can flip the glove and then insert her hand in it. In the first case, the first finger will go into the first sheath, the second finger into the second one, and so on. However, when she flips the glove, her first finger will go into the N-th sheath, the second finger into the (N-1)-th and so on — the i-th finger will go into the N+1-i-th sheath for each valid i. Of course, for her to wear the glove comfortably, each finger's length should be less than or equal to the length of the sheath it goes into. Find out whether Chef can wear the glove by keeping its front side facing her, or if she can wear it by flipping it over and facing its back side. If she can only wear the glove in the former way, output ""front""; if she can wear it only in the latter way, output ""back"".

Otherwise, look at the previous occurrence of x in the sequence, i.e. the k-th element, where k<lk<lk lt l, this element is equal to x and all elements between the k+1k+1k+1-th and l−1l−1l-1-th are different from x. The next element is l−kl−kl-k, i.e. the distance between the last two occurrences of x. The resulting sequence is (0,0,1,0,2,0,2,2,1,…)(0,0,1,0,2,0,2,2,1,…)(0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, ldots): the second element is 0 since 0 occurs only once in the sequence (0)(0)(0), the third element is 1 since the distance between the two occurrences of 0 in the sequence (0,0)(0,0)(0, 0) is 1, the fourth element is 0 since 1 occurs only once in the sequence (0,0,1)(0,0,1)(0, 0, 1), and so on.

We talk about one such session in a famous college. There are a total of N candidates (numbered from 1 to N) and M companies (numbered from 1 to M) taking part in it. Each candidate has a certain minimum expectation of salary, which is given by the array minSalary (All the arrays are 1-indexed). For each candidate, you are also given the information regarding the companies which have selected him. This information is given by an array qual of size N * M, where qual[i][j] = 1 if and only if the i-th candidate has qualified for a job in the j-th company. A company will provide a fixed salary to the candidates it employs, which is given by the array offeredSalary. Also, a company has an upper bound on the number of candidates it can employ and finally give an offer to. This information is provided by array maxJobOffers. The D-day has come. Each candidate from 1, 2, .. N (in this order) will go to the placements coordinator. When the i-th student goes, among the companies which have selected him, and which still haven't reached their maxJobOffers limit, he picks the company which provides the maximum offeredSalary, provided that it is at least his minSalary. You have to find the number of the candidates that will end up with a job, the total amount of salaries that the candidates will get, and the number of companies that won't be able to employ even a single candidate.

Chefs have packages of bread each having 4 pieces of bread, and their travel lasts 3 days. In the first day, they must eat 3 pieces of bread. So they open new package of bread and eat 3 pieces. They forget to close the package, so the 4th piece becomes bad. In the next day, they want to eat one piece of bread. And in the first package we don't have any good pieces of bread left, so they open a new package of bread and eat one piece from that. On the 3rd day, they want to eat 2 pieces of bread. In the second package, we have three pieces, and one of them is bad; so we have 2 good pieces. They eat 2 pieces from this package. So they must buy 2 packages of bread. Please help chefs in finding out the minimum number of packages of breads they should take with them on the tour.

Chef Goes to the Cinema ,"Chef lives in Chefcity. Chefcity can be represented as a straight line with Chef's house at point 0 on this line. There is an infinite number of subway stations in Chefcity, numbered by positive integers. The first station is located at point 1 and for each i ≥ 1, the distance between stations i and i+1 is equal to i+1. (Station i+1 is always located at a higher coordinate than station i, i.e., the subway stations are located at points 1, 3, 6, 10, 15 etc.) Subway trains in Chefcity allow Chef to move between any pair of adjacent stations in one minute, regardless of the distance between them. Chef can also move by walking; his walking speed is one unit of distance in one minute. Chef can enter or exit the subway at any station. Chef has decided to go to the cinema. The only cinema in Chefcity is located at point X. (Note that the cinema can be placed at the same point as a subway station.) Help Chef determine the minimum possible time required to get to the cinema from his house.

The Nights Watch ,"There are N watchtowers built in a row. Each watchtower can only accommodate one person. Some of them are already occupied by members of the Night's Watch. Since the members of the Night's Watch do not get along, no two consecutive towers can be occupied at any moment. Arya heard that the wildlings are planning an attack. She is not satisfied by the current security, so she plans to place more members of the Night's Watch in the empty towers. What is the maximum number of people she can place in the towers such that no two consecutive towers are occupied afterwards? Note that Arya may not remove anyone from already occupied towers.

Same Snake ,"Consider a 2d-grid. That is, each cell is identified by (i,j). You have received reports of two snake-sightings on this grid. You want to check whether they could be partial sightings of the same snake or not. Each of the snake sightings correspond to a straight, axis-parallel line segment in the grid, and the starting and ending cells for each are given to you. Now consider a graph, where each cell in the 2d-grid is a vertex. And there is an edge between 2 vertices if and only if the cells corresponding to these two vertices are consecutive cells in at least one of the two snakes. That is, at least in one of the snakes, when you go from one end point to the other end point, these two cells should occur consecutively. The two sightings/snakes are said to be same, if both these conditions are satisfied: The union of the set of cells in the first snake and the set of cells in the second snake, should form a connected component in this graph. No vertex should have degree more than 2 in the graph. In other words, the induced subgraph on the union set must be a path graph.

He wrote N solutions (numbered 1 through N) for this problem; some of the solutions are intended to pass, while other ones are intended to fail on some tests. He has submitted all of his solutions to this problem in a testing contest. For each solution, the system returned a (possibly empty) list of tests on which this solution failed as feedback. There are three possible outcomes: If there is a solution which is intended to pass all tests, but fails on some test, the tests are invalid. If the tests are not invalid and there is a solution which is intended to fail on some test, but passes all tests, the tests are weak. If the tests are not invalid or weak, they are fine.

Chef has a matrix that consists of n rows, each contains m elements. Initially, the element aij of matrix equals j. (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m). Then p times some element aij is increased by 1. Then Chef needs to calculate the following: For each row he tries to move from the last element (with number m) to the first one (with the number 1). While staying in aij Chef can only move to aij - 1 only if aij - 1 ≤ aij. The cost of such a movement is aij - aij - 1. Otherwise Chef can't move and lose (in this row). If Chef can move from the last element of the row to the first one, then the answer is the total cost of all the movements. If Chef can't move from the last element of the row to the first one, then the answer is -1. Help Chef to find answers for all the rows after P commands of increasing.

King Killing ,"In a faraway kingdom there are N cities numbered 1 to N connected to each other in the form of a tree. The city numbered 1 is the kingdom where the king resides. A city is called a leaf if it is not the kingdom and it has exactly one adjacent city. Each leaf city has an assassin. The enemies of the king have announced a huge reward for the assassination of the king. Each assassin starts moving from his current city following the shortest path to the kingdom. It takes exactly 1 day for an assassin to move to an adjacent city.. The assassins don’t want to split the reward, so if an assassin A encounters any other assassin B ahead of him on the same path that A is supposed to follow (no matter how far ahead), then A uses his magical power to attack B. After all the magical powers were used, every assassin who was attacked dies. Suppose A is a living assassin who attacked somebody. Now, A will move directly to the position of the assassin closest to the kingdom that A attacked, with the cost of 1 day. If there are multiple assassins in the same city simultaneously, they form a pact not to kill each other and start moving together. Once an assassin reaches the kingdom, he cannot be killed anymore, since he can kill the king, take the reward, and leave. Your task is to find which assassin will reach the kingdom first and in how many days. If more than one assassin reaches the kingdom simultaneously, output all of them in sorted order.

Signature ,"Chef bought an electronic board and pen. He wants to use them to record his clients' signatures. The board is a grid with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M) of pixels. Initially, all pixels are white. A client uses the electronic pen to sign on the board; whenever the pen touches a pixel, this pixel becomes black. Note that a signature may be non-continuous (a client may lift the pen while signing). Chef stores a typical signature of his current client as a matrix of characters Ai,jAi,jA_{i, j}, where for each valid i and j, Ai,jAi,jA_{i, j} is either '1' (if the cell in the i-th row and j-th column is black) or '0' (if this cell is white). The client just signed on the board; this signature is stored in the same form as a matrix Bi,jBi,jB_{i, j}. Chef wants to know how close this signature is to this client's typical signature. Two signatures are considered the same if it is possible to choose (possibly negative) integers drdrdr and dcdcdc such that for each 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N1 le i le N and 1≤j≤M1≤j≤M1 le j le M, Ai,j=Bi+dr,j+dcAi,j=Bi+dr,j+dcA_{i, j} = B_{i + dr, j + dc}. Here, if Bi+dr,j+dcBi+dr,j+dcB_{i + dr, j + dc} does not correspond to a valid cell, it is considered to be '0'. To compare the signatures, the colours of zero or more cells must be flipped in such a way that the signatures become the same (each flipped cell may be in any matrix).

To apply for the colleges, every student has to give a common exam, the result of which decides their destiny, i.e, the student having best rank (scoring max marks) gets to choose the college of their preference first. Each student has a list of colleges that they like. They will want to get to the best-ranked college from their list. If they can't get into it, they will want to get into the second-ranked college from among their list, and so on. If the single vacant seat of a college gets filled, the admission for that year is closed in that college. Then, the people who have applied for that college have to look for a lower-ranked college in their preference list provided that it still has vacancies.

Water Sort Puzzle (Challenge) ,"Chef wants to study reactions between non-miscible reagent samples with different colours. There are N colours (numbered 1 through N). Chef has N+2N+2N+2 test tubes (numbered 1 through N+2N+2N+2), each of them can hold a volume M ml; initially, tubes N+1N+1N+1 and N+2N+2N+2 are empty, while for each i (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N1 le i le N), the i-th tube is completely filled and contains M ml of reagents with some colours. Since reagents with different colours do not mix, we can describe the contents of the i-th tube from its bottom to its top by a sequence Bi,1,Bi,2,…,Bi,MBi,1,Bi,2,…,Bi,MB_{i,1}, B_{i,2}, ldots, B_{i,M}, i.e. for each valid j, the j-th mililiter of volume of the i-th tube, measured from the bottom, is filled by a reagent with a colour Bi,jBi,jB_{i,j}. The total initial volume of each reagent is equal to M ml. To facilitate his study, Chef wants to redistribute the reagents into tubes according to their colours, i.e. at the end, for each colour i, there must be exactly one tube which contains all M ml of this reagent and no reagents with other colours. The specific positions of reagents or empty tubes in this final state do not matter. In order to achieve this, you may first reverse the order of reagents in some (possibly none or all) tubes. Then, you may perform operations of two types: Choose two test tubes P and Q and transfer the topmost 1 ml of reagent from the tube P to the top of the tube Q. This is only allowed if P is non-empty and Q is not full. If Q is empty, the cost of this operation is 0. Otherwise, let's denote the colour of the topmost reagent in tube P by U and the colour of the topmost reagent in Q (before this operation) by V. If DU,V=−1DU,V=−1D_{U,V} = -1, this operation is not allowed. Otherwise, it is allowed and its cost is DU,VDU,VD_{U,V}. Choose a test tube P and increase its capacity by 1 ml. The cost of this operation is CPCPC_P. You are given the costs of pouring reagents on top of each other and information about which reagents react with each other and therefore cannot be poured on top of each other, i.e. the matrix D. It is guaranteed that Di,j=Dj,iDi,j=Dj,iD_{i,j} = D_{j,i} for each valid i and j and Di,i=0Di,i=0D_{i,i} = 0 for each valid i. You must separate the reagents (reach the state described above) using no more than 220=1,048,576220=1,048,5762^{20} = 1,048,576 operations.

Chef and Trump Cards ,"Chef is playing a card game with his friend Chefu. The rules of the game are as follows: There are two piles of cards. One pile belongs to Chef and the other to Chefu. One pile may be empty. At any moment, each card used in the game has a positive integer value. Whenever the value of a card becomes non-positive, it is removed from the game. The game is played in rounds. In each round, each player simultaneously draws one card from the top of his pile. If one player's pile is empty, this player cannot draw a card and therefore loses the game. (Note that it is impossible for both piles to be empty.) If the values of the drawn cards are equal, each player simply places the card he drew to the bottom of his pile. Otherwise, the player whose card has the higher value wins this round. This player places the card he drew to the bottom of his pile. Then, the card his opponent drew is transferred to him and he places this card to the bottom of his pile (below the card he just drew) as well. Whenever a card is transferred from one player to the other, the value of that card decreases by 1. When there is no transfer of cards between the players during 101001010010^{100} consecutive rounds, each player calculates the sum of values of the cards that are currently in his pile. If one player has a higher sum, this player wins the game. Otherwise, the game ends in a draw. You are given N cards (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the value of the i-th card is CiCiC_i. Your task is to distribute the cards between the players before the start of the game ― assign each card to one of the players. It is not necessary to distribute the cards equally between the players in any way. After you distribute the cards, each player arranges the cards in his pile in some order he chooses (not necessarily good for this player). Once the game starts, they may not rearrange their piles anymore. Find the number of distributions of cards such that it is impossible for the game to end in a draw, regardless of how the players form their starting piles. Since this number might be large, compute it modulo 1,0,0,0071,0,0,0071,0,0,007. Two distributions of cards are different if there is an integer i (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N1 le i le N) such that the i-th card belongs to Chef in one distribution and to Chefu in the other distribution.

Missing some chairs ,"A new school in Byteland is now in the process of renewing some classrooms with new, stronger and better chairs, so that the students can stay still and pay attention to class :) However, due to budget and logistic reasons, it's only possible to carry a chair at a time to the classroom, which means that for a long time, many students will be up, waiting for their chair to arrive. The teacher, however, as she is very clever, decided to challenge her students with a problem: ""Imagine that there are N students in the classroom and that there are only K chairs. In how many ways, can I choose K elements from the class to sit down, if I see them as being distinct?"" Lira replied immediately with the right answer, so, the teacher decided to make the game a little funnier: ""Okay Lira, as you are so fast, now I want you to tell me exactly the same thing, but, with the addition that the value of K is changing, this is, I want you to tell me the sum of the number of ways I can sit down K of you, if the value of K goes from 1 (meaning that there are no chairs in the classroom but one) to N (meaning that all of your chairs arrived). Can you be as fast now? As the answer might get large I want you to tell me the result modulo 1007.

Climbing Stairs ,"There is a ritual that some monks of Byteland perform every century as a sign of respect and worship towards BOOL, the God of Byteland. All the monks train for many years in order to accomplish an extremely hard task, that is the one of accessing the sacred temple of Byteland, where only the best of the bests monks are allowed to enter and worship their god, BOOL. The training the monks perform, usually consists of several physically and intellectually challenging tasks, trained and perfected over the course of many years, so that one of them can be eligible for the ultimate task that is a combination of both physical effort as well as mental effort. This final task is the actual possibility of trying to access the sacred temple of Byteland, that is located on the top of a very high mountain, where reckless storms and heavy rains usually occur. The access to this mountain is done by climbing an enourmous set of stairs that spiral around the mountain until it ends on the top of the mountain where the sacred temple door is located. The door can only be opened by unlocking it. To unlock the door, the monk only sees a hole in it, a lever, and he also spots a very large amount of little round stones on the ground, and he understands that the only way to open the door is to place an exact pre-determined amount of stones trough that hole, so that when the number is correct, he will push the lever down, and the door will open. If this number is incorrect, the lever will be locked by the incorrect stones and a whole new century must pass so that the storms can erode the stones and a new monk can be selected for the task. This year, YOU were the one selected to climb the huge set of stairs, and you are extremely well prepared. You have done your training very well and you are also aware of two very important facts that will be key for your success. The favourite number base on Byteland is base 2, and Gods favourite number is the largest number on this base. You also know that the number of stones you need to place on the door hole is related to the way everyone climbs the stairs and with the number of stairs itself. As the monks take several supplies for the demanding trip, they can only climb either one or two steps at a time. You understood that the number of stones you need to place on the door is closely related with the way you climb the stairs. Suppose the number of stairs you need to climb is N. Also, let the number of ways you have of climbing those N stairs be M. Now, the number of stones required is equal to the number of 1's in the base-2 representation of (M modulo 1007). You won't fail, as you are extremely well ready, but you have made everyone on your town extremely excited with your journey, so, given the number N of steps you are to climb and a guess, G, from the people of your village, you need to see if they are correct or not. More formally, given a number N of steps to climb and a guess G from your village, you need to check if guess G is accordingly to your correct calculations. They are correct if you manage to enter the temple using their guess, or incorrect otherwise. You should output the string “CORRECT” if they are correct, or “INCORRECT” if they are incorrect. (Quotes for clarity only). Please read the section ""Output Explanation"" for some clarification on the example cases.

Mysterious Sequence ,"Chef has invited Alice for his birthday party. Now, Alice is thinking about what to give Chef as a present. She should obviously choose a sequence ― what could possibly be a better birthday gift than a sequence! After some thinking, Alice chose a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,ANA_1, A_2, ldots, A_N. However, she does not want to simply give this sequence to Chef. Instead, she decided to give Chef a sequence B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BNB_1, B_2, ldots, B_N, where Bi=⋁ij=1AjBi=⋁j=1iAjB_i = bigvee_{j=1}^i A_j for each valid i and ⋁⋁bigvee denotes the bitwise OR operation. Chef can try to generate a sequence A from B, but there could be more than one such possible sequence. Now, Alice is wondering how many sequences A correspond to the given sequence B. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7. Note that it is not guaranteed that the given sequence B was generated from some sequence A.

Remy paints the fence ,"Our chef Remy ate all the delicious food he made. As a result, he has become really fat :). Chef's assistant Linguini has taken up the herculean task of bringing back chef Remy to shape. Linguini has built a fence which has N planks in a straight line. The planks are numbered 1 to N from left to right. In front of M of these N planks, he has put a bucket of paint. The paints may be of different colors. Each color is represented by any uppercase letter (A-Z). Chef Remy needs to paint the fence. He uses his painting brush to paint the fence. Chef Remy starts the task by choosing a plank which has a bucket of paint in front of it and dips his brush in the bucket. He starts walking randomly along the straight fence passing the planks. He never moves out of the fence. Note that walking randomly along a fence means that Remy keeps walking all the time along his current direction. He can change his direction any time he wishes. Moving along a straight fence has just two directions, forward and backward. Linguini has devised the following recipe for painting the fence. Each bucket has an infinite supply of paint. The brush can carry paint of a single color at any time. When Remy passes a paint bucket, the brush acquires the color in the bucket first. Every plank that Remy passes in his random walk must be colored with the color in the brush. A plank will be colored completely. A plank can be colored multiple times. A plank's color is the latest color it is painted with. A fence coloring is complete when each plank is painted with some color. Linguini is watching Remy dance around with colors. He wonders how many different complete fence colorings will he be able to see. Two fence colorings are different if there is atleast one plank numbered x whose color differs in both the colorings. Find out the number of different complete fence colorings modulo 1009. Tags: ad-hoc Algorithms, Constructive ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/FATCHEF,CC

In this problem we consider only five 2,2cm✕1,1cm patterns of flags: There are N different colors available to paint the flags and the colors are denoted by integers from 1 to N. Mike wants you to count the number of different well-painted flags. We call a flag well-painted if it's made according to the following algorithm: Pick up one of the flag patterns considered above; Paint each one-colored polygon on the pattern in a color encoded by an integer from 1 to N. Different colors are encoded with different integers. If two different one-colored polygons share a common side(not corner), than they must be painted in different colors. In any other case they can be painted in both equal and different colors. Two flags are different, if they look different(have at least one pixel painted with different color). Help Mike!

Binary Tournament ,"Knights' tournaments were quite popular in the Middle Ages. A lot of boys were dreaming of becoming a knight, while a lot of girls were dreaming of marrying a knight on a white horse. In this problem we consider one of these tournaments. Let's us call a tournament binary, if it runs according to the scheme described below: Exactly N knights take part in the tournament, N=2K for some integer K > 0. Each knight has a unique skill called strength, described as an integer from the interval [1, N]. Initially, all the knights are standing in a line, waiting for a battle. Since all their strengths are unique, each initial configuration can be described as a permutation of numbers from 1 to N. There are exactly K rounds in the tournament, 2K - i + 1 knights take part in the i'th round. The K'th round is called the final. The i'th round runs in the following way: for each positive integer j ≤ 2K - i happens a battle between a knight on the 2∙j'th position and a knight on the 2∙j+1'th position. The strongest of two continues his tournament, taking the j'th position on the next round, while the weakest of two is forced to leave. The only knight, who has won K rounds, is the winner. The only knight, who has won K - 1 rounds, but lost the final, is the runner-up. As you can see from the scheme, the winner is always the same, an initial configuration doesn't change anything. So, your task is to determine chances of each knight to appear in the final. Formally, for each knight you need to count the number of initial configurations, which will lead him to the final. Since the number can be extremly huge, you are asked to do all the calculations under modulo 109 + 9. Tags: Combinatorics Mathematics ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/BINTOUR,CC

Collecting Magical Berries ,"ChefLand is very famous for its magical forests. There you can find a lot of different trees, fruits, mushrooms and many other charming things. Recently, N bushes of magical berries (numbered 1 to N) have been discovered. The berries are in fact very tasty, and it has become very popular among the tourists to pick these berries (don't worry, as the berries are magical, they'll grow next night again :) ). Groups of tourists often want to go for a walk to pick some berries. For the i-th group it is known that it consists of Ki people and they will collect all the berries, from Ki consecutive bushes, beginning from the Li-th, going to the Li+1-th, the Li+2-th and so on. Generally, a plan of the i-th group of tourists can be described by the numbers Li and Ri - the leftmost and the rightmost bush for the i-th group. When the group have picked some amount of berries, we consider that they've picked all the berries from the bushes from the Li-th to the Ri-th, they want to divide them fairly. Fair division is a division in such a way, that the difference between the maximal and the minimal number of berries a single tourist from the group receives is less than two. All the berries (even from a single bush) are different. Generally, there are a lot of ways to divide them fairly. For example, you can divide fairly two berries between two tourists in two ways. Some tourists are fond of dividing the berries. So, they will get upset if the number of ways to divide them is too small. But some tourists will get upset if the number of ways if too huge, they will find it quite confusing. So, the ChefLand tourist agency has offered the following service: for each group of tourists they tell the number of ways to divide the berries fairly among them after the walk. As they currently don't have enough employees, they've asked you to help them. Of course, the number of berries on bushes changes during a day. You'll receive this information. Also, you'll receive the information about the groups of tourists. For each group of tourists, please tell the number of ways to divide collected berries fairly. We understand that this number can be quite huge, so we ask you to calculate it modulo 3046201.

For example strings ""abcd"" and ""acbd"" are similar, strings ""ab"" and ""ab"" are similar, but strings ""abcde"" and ""bcdea"" are not similar. Note that strings ""abc"" and ""cab"" are also similar, as you can swap 'a' and 'c' in the first string to get ""cba"" and 'a' and 'b' in the second string to get ""cba"". Now Sereja is interested in finding number of ordered pairs of non similar strings X and Y such that they can be constructed from a given string A by permutation of its characters. As answer could be large, please output your answer modulo (109 + 7). Note A string s (of size n) is said to be constructed from string t (also of size n) by permutation of its characters if there exists a permutation P (of length n), such that s[i] = t[P[i]] for each i from 1 to n.

Code Koroo Naaa ,"Adreja was bored of playing PUBG and asked her grandfather Aurobindo for assigning her any interesting task. Being a Bengali, Aurobindo said “Code Koroo Na….” (which means do coding). She then decided to write a code for generating random strings containing uppercase and lowercase English alphabets (i.e. a−zA−Za−zA−Z{a-zA-Z}). She wrote the code and generated N strings randomly using her code and showed them to Aurobindo. Aurobindo was impressed by her coding abilities, so he gifted her a plate of rosogolla. Her younger brother Nishit also wanted to have rosogolla from Aurobindo. To impress Aurobindo, Nishit decided to tell him which string is palindrome. But, Nishit has learnt about the English alphabets recently, and knows the lowercase representations of all alphabets, but he knows uppercase representations of only K alphabets. Thus, he considers the other uppercase alphabets to be different alphabets from their lowercase representations. For Example, if he knows both the representations of only 1 alphabet, say ′m′′m′'m', then he will consider ′m′′m′'m' and ′M′′M′'M' to be the same, but for other 252525 alphabets he will consider both of its representations, like ′b′′b′'b' and ′B′′B′'B' as two different alphabets. You are Adreja's best friend, and to test your coding abilities she has asked you to write a program that prints the probability that a string of given length generated by her code will be identified as a palindrome by Nishit. She further told you that it can be proved that the required probability can be represented in the form P/QP/QP/Q where P and Q are co-prime integers.Thus, she wants the required probability as P.Q−1mod(109+7)P.Q−1mod(109+7)P.Q^{-1}mod (10^9 + 7), where Q−1Q−1Q^{-1} denotes the modular multiplicative inverse of Q(Q(Q (modulo (109+7))(109+7))(10^9 +7)).

Chef has already played N rounds, but he can't remember what the levels were in all the rounds. He will give you an array A of length N such that Ai is equal to -1 if Chef can't remember what level the i-th round was, otherwise it will contain positive integer denoting the level of the round.

Lasers Everywhere Alternative ,"This is an interactive problem. When Vivek was creating the problem LAZER, he realised that it can be used to create a different, interactive problem. Can you solve this problem too? Let's frame this problem formally. You are given integers N, M, K and Q. Consider a random sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,ANA_1, A_2, ldots, A_N, where each element is generated independently and uniformly randomly between 1 and M (inclusive). As described in the problem statement of LAZER, we create line segments between pairs of points (i,Ai)(i,Ai)(i, A_i) and (i+1,Ai+1)(i+1,Ai+1)(i+1, A_{i+1}) for each valid i. The height of a line segment connecting points (x1,y1)(x1,y1)(x_1, y_1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2)(x_2, y_2) is defined as |y1−y2||y1−y2||y_1-y_2|. You are given Q queries. In each query, you are given integers L and R; you should consider the line segments such that the x-coordinates of their endpoints lie between L and R inclusive, and you should find the maximum of heights of these segments. Your task is to answer these queries. However, the sequence A is hidden and you may only ask at most K questions (of a different type from the queries you should answer). In each of your questions: You should choose integers x1x1x_1, x2x2x_2 and y, where 1≤x1<x2≤N1≤x1<x2≤N1 le x_1 lt x_2 le N and 1≤y≤1091≤y≤1091 le y le 10^9. Consider a laser beam fired horizontally to the right from the point (x1,y)(x1,y)(x_1,y), which stops at the point (x2,y)(x2,y)(x_2,y) and does not propagate further. This beam collides with zero or more of the line segments described above. The beam is considered to collide with a line segment if it intersects or touches this segment, except when the left endpoint of this segment is (x2,y)(x2,y)(x_2, y) or its right endpoint is (x1,y)(x1,y)(x_1, y). The answer to this question is the maximum of heights of the segments with which it collides or the information that it does not collide with any segments. Interaction The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for T test cases follows. For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing four space-separated integers N, M, K and Q. Then, you should read Q lines. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers L and R describing one of the queries which you should answer. Then, you may ask questions. To ask a question, you should print a line containing four space-separated integers 1, x1x1x_1, x2x2x_2 and y. Then, you should read a line containing a single integer H. If the question was invalid or if you asked too many questions, H=−1H=−1H = -1. Otherwise, if the beam in this question does not collide with any segments, then H=−2H=−2H = -2. Otherwise, H is the maximum of heights of the segments with which the beam collides. When you have determined the answer, you should print a line containing Q+1Q+1Q + 1 space-separated integers 2, ans1ans1ans_1, ans2ans2ans_2, …, ansQansQans_Q, where for each valid i, ansiansians_i is the answer to the i-th query. This does not count as a question. Finally, you should read a line containing a single integer: 1 if your answer is correct or −1−1-1 if it is incorrect. If your answer was correct, you should continue solving the remaining test cases. Note that when you receive −1−1-1 (either as the response to a question or to your answer), you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Since by asking x1=1x1=1x_1=1, x2=2x2=2x_2=2 and y=1y=1y=1, we got the answer 0, it obviously means that the answer to the first query is 0. Similarly, since by asking x1=3x1=3x_1=3, x2=4x2=4x_2=4 and y=2y=2y=2, we got the answer 1, which is the largest possible height of a line segment here, the answer to the second query is 1. The answer to the third query cannot be smaller than the answer to the second query, so it is also 1.

Winning Ways 2 ,"Chef's Combinatorial Games Competition is starting again this year, and the qualification round is happening right now! This time, Chef is keeping it simple ― there will be two-player games with the following rules: Initially, the players are given an integer sequence S. The players alternate turns. In each turn, the current player must choose one or more elements of the current sequence S such that the values of all chosen elements are identical, and erase these elements from S. When a player cannot choose anything (the sequence S is already empty), this player loses the game. Since Chef is currently busy planning for the finals, he does not have time to prepare sequences for all qualification games. Instead, he chose a large sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,ANA_1, A_2, ldots, A_N and he wants to use its contiguous subsequences for the games. To get a idea of how these games will turn out, Chef wants you to answer Q queries. In each query, you are given a subsequence AL,AL+1,…,ARAL,AL+1,…,ARA_L, A_{L+1}, ldots, A_R, and you have to find the number of winning moves the first player can play on the first turn. Since this number can be quite large, compute it modulo 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353. Assume that both players play optimally. The queries are independent ― the sequence A does not change.

Ways to Work ,"Chef is working at his dream workplace with N−1N−1N-1 of his friends! Like any dream workplace, this one also has dream work conditions. To ensure absolute happiness of the employees, there are the following rules at the company: Each worker works on exactly one day! You heard it right: no more, no less. On each day, at most one worker may work. This provides the perfect work conditions: no crowd, just the work and you. Every worker has a deadline; let's denote the deadline of the i-th worker by didid_i. (This means that the day on which the i-th worker works must not be later than day didid_i; the days are numbered starting from 1.) You thought there weren't any limitations, eh? However, sooner or later, all dream workplaces have to fall. The CLO (Chefland Labour Office) demands that there should be exactly C ways to schedule the work such that the above conditions are fulfilled. Two schedulings are different if there is an employee that works at different days in these schedulings. Chef is asking for your help, since he can't spare any workdays at this company. You should find a sequence of employees' deadlines d1≤d2≤⋯≤dNd1≤d2≤⋯≤dNd_1 le d_2 le dots le d_N such that there are exactly C ways to schedule the work.

Counting D-sets ,"Chef likes points located at integer coordinates in a space having N dimensions. In particular, he likes sets of such points having diameter exactly equal to D (called D-sets). The diameter of a set of points is the maximum distance between any pair of points in the set. The distance between two points (a1,a2,.,aN) and (b1,b2,.,bN) is max{|a1-b1|, |a2-b2|, ., |aN-bN|}. Chef would like to know how many D-sets exist. However, he soon realized that, without any extra constraints, there is an infinite number of D-sets. Thus, he would only like to count the number of classes of D-sets, such that any two D-sets which belong to the same class are equivalent under translation. To be more precise, two D-sets X and Y are considered equivalent (and belong to the same class) if: they contain the same number of points AND there exists a tuple of N integer numbers (t1, ., tN) such that by translating each point of X by the amount ti in dimension i (1≤i≤N) we obtain the set of points Y. Let's consider N=2, D=4 and the following sets of points X={(1,2), (5,5), (4,3)} and Y={(2,5), (5,6), (6,8)}. Let's consider now the tuple (1,3). By translating each point of X by the amounts specified by this tuple we obtain the set {(2,5), (6,8), (5,6)}, which is exactly the set Y. Thus, the two sets X and Y are equivalent and belong to the same class. Help Chef find the number of classes of D-sets modulo 1007 (109+7).

The player who is unable to make a move loses. Srijan and Ankit are going to play this game. Ankit, being younger, always gets to start the game. However, Srijan, being clever, sneaks into the game arena early and permutes the order of piles. Then, the game is played on this new order of piles.

He is a quite particular about natural beauty, so he will not attach strings such that one of the string on a watch is prefix (not necessarily proper prefix) of some other string on other watch. Also alphabet size of characters in the string is equal to first K English Alphabets. (i.e. 1 ≤ K ≤ 26).

Code To Get Her ,"Jiraiya, one of the Konohagakure’s Sanin, is out for a world tour for M months with his disciple Naruto Uzumaki, in search of knowledge that would help his friends. On his journey, he discovers a fact S (a string) every month. Also, he makes a list of several ladies who can help him in his important research for that month. But, he can meet exactly one of them at the end of month. To select the one, he first calculates the score for each lady in his list. He defines score for each lady based on her name as: “Total number of subsequences of fact S, which are anagrams of the name, modulo 998244353998244353998244353” Jiraiya meets the lady with the highest score. If there are more than one ladies with the highest score, he meets the one whose name comes first in his list. If all names have score 0, then he cannot meet anyone. Naruto knows that this task will make his master, Jiraiya, spend too much time on calculations. So, he wants to help his master by writing a program which can do the above task quickly, so that his master can spend more time on his training. He wants the program to calculate the score for each lady in Jiraiya’s list, and finally print the result, i.e. the name of the lady whom Jiraiya will meet. If Jiraiya cannot meet anyone, the result should be ”No Research This Month” (without quotes). Since Naruto is not good at coding, he wants your team’s help to code this out. Note: A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Two subsequences are considered different if the positions of deleted elements (in the original string) are different for both the subsequences (Even if these two subsequences look similar). For Example: If abbabbabb is the original string, then the subsequences ababab and ababab will be considered different if they represent the positions {1,2}{1,2}{1,2} and {1,3}{1,3}{1,3} in the original string respectively. An anagram of a string is any rearrangement of that string. For example, for the sting abbabbabb, these strings are anagrams: abb, bab, bbaabb, bab, bbaabb, bab, bba.

For each i (1≤i≤k1≤i≤k1 le i le k), let's denote the sweetness of the i-th chocolate chosen by Chef by AiAiA_i. Chef's brother does the same thing ― k times, he also chooses a chocolate from the box uniformly randomly and independently from each other or Chef's choices (so each chocolate may still be chosen multiple times).

BiCo Gaming Grid ,"The much anticipated video game ""BiCo Grid"" has been released. The rules of ""Bico Grid"" are very simple. The game field is a 100x100 matrix, where each cell is either a blocked cell, or a cell with some number of coins. For a regular player the look of the field seems pretty random, but the programmer in you recognizes the following pattern: the i-th cell on the n-th row contains C(n, i) coins if and only if 0 ≤ i ≤ n, all other cells are blocked. Record C(n, i) denotes binomial coefficient ""n choose i"". The player starts from the cell situated at row R and column C in the matrix. The objective is to collect exactly G number of coins from matrix in several moves. There are some rules: On each move the player must collect all the coins from some unblocked cell in the current column. The rules of the game state, that player mustn't be really greedy, so the number of coins he collected must not increase. In other words, if at some move the player collected X coins then further he cannot collect more than X coins in a single move. After each move, the player is immediately moved to some cell of the column W-1 (where W denotes the current column of the player). If the current column of the player has index 0, the game ends. The game ends when player collects exactly G number of coins. You are given the description of the game. Please, output the sequence of moves that win the game (collect exactly G coins)!

Encoded String ,"An encoder encodes the first 161616 lowercase English letters using 4 bits each. The first bit (from the left) of the code is 0 if the letter lies among the first 8 letters, else it is 1, signifying that it lies among the last 8 letters. The second bit of the code is 0 if the letter lies among the first 4 letters of those 8 letters found in the previous step, else it's 1, signifying that it lies among the last 4 letters of those 8 letters. Similarly, the third and the fourth bit each signify the half in which the letter lies. For example, the letter j would be encoded as : Among (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h | i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p)i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p)i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p), j appears in the second half.

Dilemma ,"Chef has no work to do in the kitchen, so he decided to play a card game with the following rules: Initially, N cards are placed in a row on a table. Each card is placed either face up or face down. The goal of the game is to remove all cards from the table, one by one. A card may be removed only if it is currently facing up. When a card is removed, its adjacent cards (the cards directly to its left and right, if they exist) are flipped, i.e. a card that was facing up will be facing down and vice versa. There is an empty space left behind each removed card, i.e. the remaining cards are not moved to create a contiguous row of cards again. Therefore, if the game starts with three cards and the middle card is removed, then the cards on the sides are flipped, but removing one of these cards afterwards does not cause the other card to be flipped, since it is only adjacent to the empty space created by removing the middle card. Determine whether Chef is able to win this game. Tags: ad-hoc Algorithms, Constructive ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/CHEFDIL,CC
Penalty Shoot-Out II ,"Teams A and B are having a penalty shoot-out to decide the winner of their football match. Each team gets to take a shot N times, and the team with the higher number of scored goals at the end wins. If the number of goals scored during the shoot-out by each team turns out to be the same even after all 2N2N2N shots, then they stop and agree that the result is a draw. The two teams take shots alternately — team A shoots first, then team B shoots, then team A and so on until team B takes its N-th shot (at which point each team has taken exactly N shots). Even though all 2N2N2N shots are taken, the result of the shoot-out is often known earlier — e.g. if team A has already scored N−1N−1N-1 goals and team B has missed at least two shots, team A is definitely the winner. For each shot, you know whether it was a goal or a miss. You need to find the earliest moment when the winner is known — the smallest s (0≤s≤2N0≤s≤2N0 le s le 2N) such that after s shots, the result of the shoot-out (whether team A won, team B won or the match is drawn) would be known even if we did not know the results of the remaining 2N−s2N−s2N-s shots.

Roads in Chefland ,"In Chefland, there are N cities (numbered 1 through N). Initially, there are no roads between them. The Mayor of Chefland has ordered engineers to build roads across Chefland in such a way that each city is reachable from all other cities. For each pair of distinct cities i and j, the cost of building a road between these cities is equal to (i∧ji∧ji wedge j), where ∧∧wedge denotes the bitwise AND operation. However, leaders of the cities have a weird condition ― they only allow roads with positive costs to be built from their cities. Help the Mayor find the minimum cost of building roads in the required way or determine that it is impossible.

Grid Tour ,"Chef has an integer K and a grid with N rows (numbered 0 through N−1N−1N-1) and M columns (numbered 0 through M−1M−1M-1). Let's denote the cell in row r and column c by (r,c)(r,c)(r, c). A tour in the grid is a sequence of cells such that each cell of the grid occurs in this sequence at least once. The starting cell may be chosen arbitrarily. Then, for each cell (x,y)(x,y)(x, y) except the final cell (but including the starting cell), the next cell in the sequence must be one of the following: (x,(y+K)%M)(x,(y+K)%M)left( x, (y+K) % M right) ((x+K)%N,y)((x+K)%N,y)left( (x+K) % N, y right) ((x+K)%N,(y+K)%M)((x+K)%N,(y+K)%M)left( (x+K) % N, (y+K) % M right) Each cell may occur multiple times in the sequence and the final cell does not have to be the same as the starting cell.

Mathison and the Dynamo shuffle ,"Mathison has bought a new deck of cards that contains 2N cards, numbered and ordered from 0 to 2N-1. Mathison is getting bored and decides to learn the Dynamo shuffle (or Sybil cut) - a flashy manner to shuffle cards. Unfortunately, the Dynamo shuffle is a little too complicated so Mathison decides to create his own shuffle. This newly invented shuffle is done in N steps. At step k (0 ≤ k < N) the deck is divided into 2k equal-sized decks where each one contains cards that lie on consecutive positions. Each one of those decks is then reordered: all the cards that lie on even positions are placed first followed by all cards that lie on odd positions (the order is preserved in each one of the two subsequences and all positions are 0-based). Then all the decks are put back together (preserving the order of decks). Mathison has spent hours practising the shuffle and he now believes that he has perfected his technique. However, Chef doesn't believe him yet so he asks Mathison to answer Q questions that given a deck of size 2N where i-th card is labelled i, find the position of the card labelled K in the final, shuffled deck.

English ,"Chef is learning English. So far, he knows N words, and he wants to write a verse. Let's call a pair of words a stanza. A verse is a list of stanzas. The prefixal rhyme of a stanza is the longest common prefix of the words in it. Similarly, the suffixal rhyme of a stanza is the longest common suffix of the words in it. The beauty of a stanza whose prefixal and suffixal rhymes have lengths lplpl_p and lslsl_s respectively is min(lp,ls)2min(lp,ls)2mathrm{min}(l_p, l_s)^2. For example, a stanza formed by the words ""abcdefghijkl"" and ""abcxyzhijkl"" has a prefixal rhyme ""abc"" (with length 3), suffixal rhyme ""hijkl"" (with length 5) and beauty min(3,5)2=32=9min(3,5)2=32=9mathrm{min}(3,5)^2 = 3^2 = 9. The beauty of a verse is the sum of beauties of all its stanzas. For example, the beauty of the verse ((""abcdefghijkl"", ""abcxyzhijkl""), (""world"", ""word""), (""code"", ""chef"")) is 9+1+0=109+1+0=109+1+0=10. You are given N words W1,W2,…,WNW1,W2,…,WNW_1, W_2, ldots, W_N (they are not necessarily distinct). Help Chef write the most beautiful verse. It is not necessary to use all the words, but each word may be used at most once in the whole verse (more precisely, each element of the sequence W may be used only once, but if some word appears k times in W, we can use it up to k times).

Impressing Chefina ,"Chef has a matrix A with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M); an element in row i and column j is denoted by Ai,jAi,jA_{i, j}. He is going to play a game on this matrix with Chefina. In the game, Chef lists the elements of the matrix row by row in an alternating pattern, starting from the top left corner ― he writes down the first row from left to right, the second row from right to left, and so on. Chefina also lists the elements of the matrix row by row, but she starts from the top right corner and writes down the first row from right to left, the second row from left to right, and so on. Chefina gets impressed if the sequences written by Chef and Chefina turn out to be the same. Chef can rearrange the matrix in any way he chooses in order to impress Chefina. In the rearranged matrix, the number of occurrences of each integer must be the same as in the original matrix.

Guess the Tiling ,"This is an interactive problem. Chef wants to decorate his kitchen with tiles. However, he is running out of money and needs to get the work done at a discount. The Slash Decorators are very proud of their skills and give an offer to Chef. The kitchen is a square grid with length N units and width N units. It is divided into N rows and N columns. The rows are numbered 1 through N from top to bottom. Similarly, the columns are numbered 1 through N from left to right. Let's denote a cell in the i-th row and j-th column by (i,j)(i,j)(i,j). The Slash Decorators want to use N2N2N^2 colourful tiles with dimensions 1×11×11 times 1 to cover the whole kitchen. The tiles can be placed in two orientations as shown in the figure below. Note that each of these two orientations can be converted to the other by rotating it 90∘90∘90^{circ} clockwise. The Slash Decorators initially filled all the cells of the kitchen with tiles, where each tile is placed in one of the two possible orientations. Chef does not know this initial configuration and his task is to find it by asking up to Q queries. In each query: Chef chooses a cell in the grid. The Slash Decorators rotate the tile in the cell 90∘90∘90^{circ} clockwise. Then, the Slash Decorators find all squares with area 2 formed by the blue diagonal lines (shown in the figure below) and tell Chef the number of these squares. In addition, the Slash Decorators initially tell Chef the number of squares with area 2 formed by the blue diagonal lines in the initial configuration. Let's denote this number by K. For example, in the configuration shown below, there are 3 squares with area 2. The queries are not independent, i.e. a tile rotated in a query stays rotated in subsequent queries. Chef may choose the same tile in multiple queries; in such a case, this tile is rotated multiple times. The offer is that if Chef guesses the initial configuration correctly, the work will be done for free. Please help him. You play as Chef and the grader plays as the Slash Decorators. You should find the configuration the kitchen is in (the orientations of all tiles) when you finish asking queries; note that this is equivalent to finding the initial configuration. Interaction First, you should read a line containing a single integer T ― the number of test cases. The description of interaction for T test cases follows. For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing three space-separated integers N, Q and K. Then, you may ask queries. For each query: Print a line containing three space-separated integers 1, X and Y. The grader rotates the tile in the cell (X,Y)(X,Y)(X, Y). Then, read a line containing a single integer Z. If you ask an invalid query or more than Q queries, Z=−1Z=−1Z = -1. Otherwise, Z denotes the number of squares with area 2 formed by the blue diagonal lines. Once you know the current configuration: Print a line containing a single integer 2. Then, for each i (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N1 le i le N), print a line containing N space-separated integers; for each valid j, the j-th of these integers should be 0 or 1 if the cell (i,j)(i,j)(i,j) currently contains a tile in the first orientation or the second orientation, respectively, shown in the first figure. Finally, you should read a line containing a single integer. If your guess was incorrect, this integer is −1−1-1. Otherwise, this integer is 1 and you should continue solving the remaining test cases. If you receive −1−1-1, you should terminate your program immediately to receive the Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Partition the Graph ,"You are given a tree G with N vertices numbered 1 through N. It is guaranteed that N is even. For a positive integer k, let's define a graph HkHkH_k as follows: HkHkH_k has N vertices numbered 1 through N. For each edge (u,v)(u,v)(u, v) in G, there is an edge (u,v)(u,v)(u, v) in HkHkH_k too. For each pair of vertices (u,v)(u,v)(u, v) in G such that their distance is at most k, there is an edge (u,v)(u,v)(u, v) in HkHkH_k. We call a graph good if its vertices can be split into two sets U and V satisfying the following: Each vertex appears in exactly one set; |U|=|V|=N/2|U|=|V|=N/2|U| = |V| = N/2. Let E be the set of edges (u,v)(u,v)(u, v) such that u∈Uu∈Uu in U and v∈Vv∈Vv in V. It is possible to reach any vertex from any other vertex using only the edges in E. Your task is to find the minimum value of k such that HkHkH_k is a good graph, and one possible way to partition vertices of this graph HkHkH_k into the sets U and V defined above.

Forced Particles ,"You are given a grid with n rows and m columns. Each cell of this grid can either be empty or it contains one particle. It can never contain more than one particle. Let's denote the cell in the i-th row and j-th column by (i,j)(i,j)(i, j), with the top left corner being (0,0)(0,0)(0, 0). From a cell (i,j)(i,j)(i, j), a particle could move in one of the following four directions: to the left, i.e. to the cell (i,j−1)(i,j−1)(i, j - 1) to the right, i.e. to the cell (i,j+1)(i,j+1)(i, j + 1) up, i.e. to the cell (i−1,j)(i−1,j)(i - 1, j) down, i.e. to the cell (i+1,j)(i+1,j)(i + 1, j) It is not possible for a particle to move to a cell that already contains a particle or to a cell that does not exist (leave the grid). It is possible to apply a force in each of these directions. When a force is applied in a given direction, all particles will simultaneously start moving in this direction as long as it is still possible for them to move. You are given a sequence of forces. Each subsequent force is applied only after all particles have stopped moving. Determine which cells of the grid contain particles after all forces from this sequence are applied in the given order.

Chef and Triangles ,"Chef is long been involved in cooking recipes. He has now got bored with it, and has to decided to play with food instead of cooking it up. He has already selected N spaghetti strands for his dish. He has to select just one extra strand such that this strand's length makes a non-degenerate triangle with some of the two other strands already present in the dish. A triangle formed by three collinear points is called a degenerate triangle. The length of the strand to be selected must be an integer in the range [L, R] (both inclusive). Formally, let array L denote the lengths of N strands, then the extra strand of length X can be selected if there exists two different indices i, j (i ≠ j) such that there can be made a triangle of side lengths Li, Lj and X. Can you help him find the number of possible valid lengths of the extra strand? Note again that three collinear points are not considered to form a triangle.

Chef and Walk ,"Chef is playing a game on the non-negative x-axis. It takes him 1 second to reach from ithithi^{th} position to (i−1)th(i−1)th(i-1)^{th} position or (i+1)th(i+1)th(i+1)^{th} position. The chef never goes to the negative x-axis. Also, Chef doesn't stop at any moment of time. The movement of chef can be described as follows. At the start he is standing at x=0x=0x=0 at time 0. In the first round, he moves towards x=1x=1x=1 and comes back to the x=0x=0x=0 position. In the second round, he moves towards the x=2x=2x=2 and comes back again to x=0x=0x=0. Generalizing, in the kthkthk^{th} round, he moves from x=0x=0x=0 to x=kx=kx=k and then returns back to x=0x=0x=0 at the end of the round. This goes on as the game progresses.

Draw another circle of radius R3 such that it touches the circle C1 from inside and the circle C2 from outside (it is given that R3 + R2 ≤ R1), let's call this circle as C3.

For each cyclic shift you choose a K-length segment of the permutation P (let's denote it as Px, Px + 1, ., Px + K - 2, Px + K - 1) and perform a cyclic shift on it towards the right. That is, rearrange elements of this segment in the order Px + K - 1, Px, . , Px + K - 3, Px + K - 2.

Lucky Balance ,"Chef has the string s of length n consisted of digits 4 and 7. The string s is called balanced if there exits such integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ n) that the number of digits 4 in substring s[1; x) is equal to the number of digits 7 in substring s(x; n], where s[1; x) is the substring from the 1st digit to (x-1)th digit of s, and s(x; n] is the substring from the (x+1)th digit to nth digit of s. For example, s = 747474 is a balanced string, because s[1; 4) = 747 has one 4 and s(4; 6] = 74 has one 7. Note that x can be 1 or n and s[1; 1) and s(n; n] denote an empty string.

Array Filling ,"You are given an array A of size N. Initially, the array is filled with 0-s. There are M types of operations that you can perform on array A. The ithithi^{th} operation can be described by two integers (xi,yi)(xi,yi)(x_i, y_i). In this operation, you choose a set of indices S such that 1≤j≤N1≤j≤N1 leq j leq N, (jmodyi)≠0(jmodyi)≠0(j bmod y_i) neq 0, Aj=0Aj=0A_j = 0, , then you set Aj=xiAj=xiA_j = x_i for all j∈Sj∈Sj in S. You can perform the operations in any order, but one type of operation can't be done more than once. What is the maximum sum of integers of the array A you obtain if you perform the M operations optimally? For example, consider the array A=[0,0,0,0]A=[0,0,0,0]A = [0, 0, 0, 0]. Suppose x=3,y=2x=3,y=2x = 3, y = 2. Here you can choose indices 1 and 3 and set A1=A3=3A1=A3=3A_1 = A_3 = 3. So the array A becomes [3,0,3,0][3,0,3,0][3, 0, 3, 0]. In this operation you can't choose the indices 2 and 4 because (2mod2)=0(2mod2)=0(2 bmod 2) = 0, (4mod2)=0(4mod2)=0(4 bmod 2) = 0. Suppose x=5,y=3x=5,y=3x = 5, y = 3 and you set A2=5A2=5A_2 = 5. So the array A becomes [3,5,3,0][3,5,3,0][3, 5, 3, 0]. Here you can't choose index 1 because A1>0A1>0A_1 gt 0 and index 3 because (3mod3)=0(3mod3)=0(3 bmod 3) = 0 and A3>0A3>0A_3 gt 0. However, you could also set A4=5A4=5A_4 = 5. Suppose x=4,y=4x=4,y=4x = 4, y = 4. Now you can't choose any index because Aj>0Aj>0A_j gt 0 for all 1≤j≤31≤j≤31 leq j leq 3 and (4mod4)=0(4mod4)=0(4 bmod 4) = 0. So the array remains same.

So, Santa wants the aliens to go back from earth, and the only way for the aliens to go back is that the GCD of the numbers (given by Santa to aliens) of every possible pair of aliens must be equal to the number of aliens. Santa wants to distribute the numbers among the aliens in such a way that the sum of numbers given to the aliens is minimum.

Selection Battle ,"Tanya and Divesh once took part in a team programming competition where they had a team of three members. The third member of their team (let's call this person as X for simplicity) is the reason why they're fighting with each other today. There is another team programming competition coming up where programmers can take part in a team of two. Now both of them want to team up with X for this upcoming team programming contest. So both of them have mutually decided to conduct a Selection Battle, whoever wins this will team up with X. Initially they have an integer N. The rules are as follows: Both players alternate turns, Tanya makes the first move. In each turn (move), a player can choose an integer K (2≤K≤N(2≤K≤N(2 leq K leq N and NmodK≡0)NmodK≡0)N bmod{K} equiv 0) and set N=NKN=NKN = frac{N}{K}. A move after which no other legal move can be made is called as the last move. The player who makes the last move loses. Assume that both players play optimally.

Square Root of LCA Convolution ,"You are given a rooted tree with N vertices (numbered 1 through N) and a prime number P. Vertex 1 is the root of the tree and for each v (2≤v≤N2≤v≤N2 le v le N), the parent of vertex v is pvpvp_v (pv<vpv<vp_v lt v). A vertex s is an ancestor of another vertex f if s lies on the path between 1 and f (in particular, f is its own ancestor). For two vertices u and v, let's define LCA(u,v)LCA(u,v)mathrm{LCA}(u, v) as the vertex s with the largest number which is an ancestor of both u and v.

Chef And Land Labeling ,"ChefsLand can be viewed as a graph consisting of N cities and bidirectional roads. Each pair of cities is directly connected by a road. Recently, Chef came up with following game to make the Number Theory course more interesting for students in country schools. At the beginning of each lesson, Chef draws ChefsLand as a graph with N vertices corresponding to cities and N(N-1)/2 edges corresponding to roads between them. Then he labels the cities; each city is given a distinct label between 1 and N (inclusive). Next, he labels each edge — the label of the edge between vertices u and v is the common divisor count of lblu and lblv (the number of positive integers which divide both lblu and lblv), where lblu and lblv denote the labels of vertices u and v respectively. Now, Chef erases the vertex labels, retaining only edge labels in the graph. You, as the number theory student, should find some assignment of labels to vertices which produces a graph with the given edge labels.

Election Bait ,"The final elections for the government of Berland are taking place. There are only two parties in these elections; let's denote them by 'A' and 'B'. A party wins the elections if it has strictly more votes than the other party; if a tie occurs, the elections are invalid. The voting system is fully electronic, so throughout the day, the current results of the elections are updated live, as soon as each vote is cast. However, what the citizens do not know is that the whole election is a setup: the parties are actually working together to make the population think party A is winning until the end of the elections, which is when party B would come out victorious. The parties want to make this work by simply ignoring all votes which are not set up by them. Instead, they want to bring N convoys of buses (numbered 1 through N) carrying people whose votes will be actually counted. Let's denote the number of buses in the i-th convoy by ViViV_i. Each bus in an odd-numbered convoy should carry X people voting for party A and each bus in an even-numbered convoy should carry Y people voting for party B. The convoys arrive in the given order. For a convoy with ViViV_i buses, the people from the first bus of this convoy cast their votes one by one, then the people from the second bus cast their votes, and so on until the people from the ViViV_i-th bus cast their votes. Then, all the people leave on the same buses before the next convoy arrives. For each bus except the last bus from the last convoy, after the people from this bus cast their votes, party A must have strictly more votes than party B. After the people from the last bus overall cast their votes, party B must have strictly more votes than party A. Party A can afford buses with at most C1C1C_1 seats and party B can affords buses with at most C2C2C_2 seats, so 1≤X≤C11≤X≤C11 le X le C_1 and 1≤Y≤C21≤Y≤C21 le Y le C_2 must hold.

Further, Sardar knows that each business has a specific value - the i-th business has value AiAiA_i. When Sardar Khan destroys a business, he also destroys every road directly connected to it. Formally, destroying business v also destroys all existing roads of the form (u,v)(u,v)(u, v).

Escape the Tree ,"Chef is trying to make his birthday party adventurous. He recently heard about escape the room games, so he wants to prepare his own version of such a game. First, Chef will lock his friends in the root of a full binary tree with depth h, i.e. with 2h+1−12h+1−12^{h+1}-1 nodes (numbered 1 through 2h+1−12h+1−12^{h+1}-1). The root has number 1, but the other nodes may be numbered arbitrarily. His friends can only escape this tree by reaching a special leaf node. They do not have any other information about the structure of the tree or the special node. The friends need to find the number of the special node. In order to do that, they may ask at most 2h+12h+12h+1 queries of the following two types: Choose a node x. Chef's response to this query is the distance between node x and the special node. Choose a node x and an integer y. Consider all leaf nodes at the distance y from node x. If there is at least one such node, Chef chooses one such node and his response is the number of the node he chose. Otherwise, Chef's response is 0. Help Chef's friends find the special node and escape the tree. Interaction First, you should read a line containing a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for T test cases follows. For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer h ― the height of the full binary tree. Then, you may ask queries. To ask a query of the first type, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 1 and x (1≤x≤2h+1−11≤x≤2h+1−11 le x le 2^{h+1}-1). Then, you must read a line containing a single integer ― the answer to your query, or −1−1-1 if the query is invalid or if you have asked too many queries. To ask a query of the second type, you should print a line containing three space-separated integers 2, x and y (1≤x≤2h+1−11≤x≤2h+1−11 le x le 2^{h+1}-1, 0≤y≤2h0≤y≤2h0 le y le 2h). Then, you must read a line containing a single integer ― the answer to your query, or −1−1-1 if the query is invalid or if you have asked too many queries. Finally, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 3 and x, where x is the number of the special leaf node. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer: 1 if your answer was correct, or −1−1-1 if it was incorrect or if you have asked too many queries. If your answer was correct, you should continue solving the remaining test cases. Note that when you receive an answer −1−1-1, you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict. For each test case, the grader decides that you have asked too many queries as soon as it detects that you have printed 2h+32h+32h+3 lines ― printing the answer is included, so this corresponds to asking more than 2h+12h+12h+1 queries. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

After Chef has arrived and settled in, he plans to create a new recipe. This will require a certain product P, but this product may not be available in the city he will be living in - he will need to travel to that city to purchase it.

Note that, the degree of a city is the number of roads connected to it before each destroy operation. Chef wants to find the minimum cost to destroy all the roads. On calculating this cost once, he finds the process very interesting. Therefore, he does this for Q more independent queries. In each query, a road is removed and another road is added.

To reduce this count, Chef considered only those trees which have at least one diameter that has alternating colors i.e. a black node is followed by a white node and a white node is followed by a black node. Help Chef in finding out the tree with the minimum possible diameter among all the trees that satisfies the above condition. If no tree satisfies the above conditions, print −1−1-1. If multiple trees satisfies the above condition, print any. Tags: Trees Data Structures, Graphs ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/ALTDIA,CC
Amazing Experiment ,"Dr.Zero lives in Treeland. Tree land consists of a tree with N nodes connected by N-1 weighted undirected edges. The nodes of the tree are numbered from 1 to N. The tree is rooted at node 1. Dr. Zero wanted to create a super amazing experiment. Before starting the experiment, he has laid out few important definitions needed. A subtree rooted at node x is defined recursively. It contains node x and the nodes in the subtrees of its children nodes. The strategic cost of a node in the subtree is defined as the distance to the farthest node from it in the whole subtree. The strategic cost of a subtree is defined by the minimum of strategic cost of all the nodes in the subtree. In the experiment, he found strategic cost of subtree of each node in the tree. Sadly, he has misplaced the paper containing those results and now seeks your help. Tags: alex77, april16, jump-pointer, medium, trees ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/AMAEXPER,CC
Secret Tree ,"This is an interactive task You are given a positive integer N. There is a tree with N nodes numbered from 1 to N which is hidden from you.

Refer to the Sample Interaction section below for a better understanding. You need to print all the edges of the tree (in any order). You are allowed to ask at most N2N2N^2 queries. Interaction Begin the interaction by reading a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow. For each test case, first read a single integer N denoting the number of nodes in the tree. After this, you can start making queries. To ask a query, output ? k a1a1a_1 a2a2a_2 a3a3a_3 …ak…akdots a_k then read a single integer 0 or 1. To output the answer, output !, and then in the next N−1N−1N-1 lines describe the edges of the tree. You can print the edges in any order. If at any time you make an invalid query or exceed the query limit, the interaction is terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.

Dynamic Trees and Queries ,"Given a directed tree with N nodes. You need to process M queries. Each node has a key and a value, a node is referenced by its key. N nodes have keys from 0 to N-1. Root always has the key equal to 0. Queries can be of the following 4 types: 1. Given a key of a node present in the tree, append a child node to it. The new node gets the smallest never-used positive integer as its key. The value of the new node will be given in the input. 2. Given a key of a node(call it A) present in the tree. Add value to the value of all the nodes present in the subtree rooted at A. 3. Given a key of a node(call it A) present in the tree. Remove the subtree rooted at A from the tree. 4.

Tree and unwanted leaves ,"The garden has a tree with too many leaves on it and gardner wants to cut the unwanted leaves. This is a rooted tree, where a node v is called parent of another node u, if there exists a directed edge from v to u. Leaf node is a node with no outgoing edges. Gardner cuts the tree in a peculiar way: For each parent node(which has a valid leaf node attached to it), he cuts x leaf nodes, such that x is a multiple of 3. Example : If a parent node has 7 leaf nodes, 6 leaf nodes will be cut and 1 will be left. If a parent has all its child nodes cut, then the parent node itself becomes a new leaf node. If new leaf nodes are created, Gardner repeats step 1 until he can cut no more leaf nodes. After completing all operations, gardner wants to know the minimum number of nodes left on the tree. It is guaranteed that the given input is a rooted tree. The root of the tree is vertex 1.

Balanced 0-1 Tree ,"You have a tree of N vertices rooted at vertex 1, where N is even. The i-th vertex has a binary value AiAiA_i written on it (i.e, each AiAiA_i is either 0 or 1). A tree is said to be balanced if and only if the number of zeros written on its vertices equals the number of ones written on its vertices. You can select some disjoint subtrees and flip the values on them (i.e, make all 0's into 1's and all 1's into 0's). Formally, you can pick any subset (possibly empty) of vertices {v1,v2,…,vk}{v1,v2,…,vk}{v_1, v_2, ldots, v_k} such that viviv_i is not an ancestor of vjvjv_j for i≠ji≠ji neq j, and flip the value of AxAxA_x for every vertex x that is contained in the subtree of some viviv_i. Find a way of performing this operation that makes the entire tree balanced. It can be proved that the solution always exists. If there are multiple possible solutions, you may print any of them. In particular, you do not need to minimize the number of subtrees that are flipped. Tags: Trees, Greedy Data Structures, Graphs, Algorithms ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/B01T,CC

Escape Plan ,"“Animal instinct. When faced with danger, seek refuge in the herd.” Jun-Ho has come to know about the escape passage route that VIPs use in case of emergency. Jun-Ho is in the leader's office and he is planning his escape from the building. The building has a tree-like structure, with the leader's office as the root. Jun-Ho has obtained information on this structure, in the form of a tree on N nodes rooted at 1. The building has some security, which can be calculated as follows: Each node of the tree has a value assigned to it — say, AiAiA_i for node i. Let u be a leaf node of the tree. The security of u is defined to be the bitwise OR of all values on the (unique) path from the root to u. Let this value be denoted LuLuL_u. The security of the tree is then defined to be the sum of the security of all its leaf nodes, i.e, the sum of LuLuL_u across all leaf nodes u of the tree. The tree is considered to be secure when Lu>0Lu>0L_u gt 0 for every leaf node u of the tree; otherwise it is said to be insecure. Jun-Ho would like the security of the tree to be as low as possible when making his escape. To this end, he can perform the following operation zero or more times: Pick a node 1≤u≤N1≤u≤N1 leq u leq N of the tree, and set Au=0Au=0A_u = 0. However, if the tree ever becomes insecure as a result of an operation, the leader is immediately alerted and will foil Jun-Ho's plan. Thus, Jun-Ho cannot perform an operation that would make the tree insecure. Help Jun-Ho find the minimum possible security the tree can have, such that the tree remains secure after every operation. Note: A leaf is a node of the tree without any child nodes. For N=1N=1N = 1, the root is also considered to be a leaf. Given input tree will be secured tree.

Vacation ,"Everybody knows that there are a lot of complicated problems on CodeChef and it’s quite difficult to solve them. However, very few people know that testing these problems is much more elaborate process than solving. Hosting Chef’s great contests would be impossible without his testers - Anton and Hiroto. The number of problems they solved and tested probably won’t fit in 32-bit integer. These guys do very big amount of work and of course they also need to have a rest. They are having vacation for the next ten days. Of course, they’ve chosen ChefLand as a place to go. There are N cities in ChefLand and every city is denoted by its integer number. Surprisingly these numbers are not to be distinct. Anton is fond of Math so he quickly counted the sum of squares of all positive integer divisors for every this number; let’s call this sum for number that denotes ith city S(i). Hiroto considers city i to be beautiful if S(i) is odd, otherwise it is ugly for him. It’s important to mention that the cities of ChefLand are connected by bidirectional roads. It took Hiroto a couple of seconds to notice that there are exactly N-1 roads and that it’s possible to reach every city from every other city by existing roads. Our testers want their vacation to consist of interesting trips. Formally trip is a path between two cities (Anton swears that there is an unique path between each pair of cities, so let’s trust him:)); the length of the trip is a number of cities it consists of. Furthermore, visiting of a single city is also a trip of length 1. The time of having any trip is equal to its length. Hiroto considers a trip to be interesting if the number of beautiful cities in it is not less than the number of ugly cities. Anton and Hiroto want to try every interesting trip. Since our testers are very smart and provident, they want to know the exact time it will take them to go through all the interesting trips. Note that if they had a trip from A to B then they are not interested in having trip from B to A.

Fire Escape Routes ,"There are N people working in a building, and each one works in a separate cabin. Chef’s employees are numbered by integers from 1 to N, inclusive. Chef wants to ensure the safety of his employees. He wants to have fire escapes in the building and wants to train the employees to use these by conducting mock drills. Chef knows that the number of people working in his office can be very large. In order to avoid crowding of a common fire escape route during emergency, Chef has decided to build multiple fire escapes. For the safety of every employee, each cabin has a fire exit which is connected to one of the fire escape routes. A lot of employees are friends with each other. The friendship is mutual. This means that if employee i is a friend of employee j then employee j is a friend of employee i as well. But friendship is NOT necessarily transitive. This means that if employee i is a friend of employee j AND employee j is a friend of employee k, then employee i and employee k need not necessarily be friends. If two employees are friends, they do not want to escape through different routes. This complicates the task for the Chef. As already mentioned, he wants to have the maximum number of fire escape routes to ensure maximum safety. Also, for every escape route, one of the employees using that route needs to be appointed as the fire drill captain. The captain will be responsible for conducting the mock drills and train all the employees using that route. Your task is simple. Given the number of employees and the friendship list, you need to tell the Chef the maximum number of fire escape routes that he can have in the building and the number of ways of selecting the captains for every route. Since the number of ways can be really large, output this value modulo 109+7109+710^{9} + 7.

Is It a Snake ,"One day I was visiting a temple in which snakes were worshiped. I happened to find a golden plate of dimension 2 * n in it. It had 2 rows of n cells each, and so the total number of cells is 2 * n. Each cell of the plate was either white or black, denoted by '.' and '#' respectively. Legend says that a snake was lying on this plate for many years and prayed. So, the cells that were covered by its body have turned black, the rest of the cells were white. Its entire body was supposedly on this plate. Also, you know that a snake likes to make itself comfortable, so none of its parts will be intersecting with its other parts. Usually, I am skeptical of such legends. So, I want to check for myself whether the legend could potentially be true or not. For example, consider the golden plate given below: ## ## Now, the legend could be true. A snake can be on it, and one possible configuration is as follows. The head of the snake is at (1, 1), then the next portion at (1, 2), then at (2, 2) and then the finally the tail at (2, 1). Notice that the parts of the snake can be adjacent only if the corresponding cells have a common side. ##.#.. .#.. There can be a snake on the plate above. ##.## .#.#. The legend is surely false if the plate is as above. These are not marks of a single snake. There could be more than one possible snakes here. But not a single snake. Given the description of the plate, figure out if the legend could be true, or if it is definitely false.

End Of The World ,"Important! Human's are in Danger. It may be The End of the Universe! Aliens had stolen the important data about the Birth of the Human beings and they kept this data in their secured Data Center. With the help of these data along with the advanced technologies Aliens had initiated a project called It's The End to get rid of the human beings and occupy the Earth. On the other side, Chef Po is a good and very well-known Hacker. He is a great human lover, so he decided to get the data back from the Aliens by hacking their Data Center. The Aliens Data Center contains various servers arranged in N rows and N columns and the Master Server will be at the last row and the last column of the Data Center. Denote the server at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column of the Data Center as Server[i][j] (1 ≤ i, j ≤ N). So in this notation Master Server is Server[N][N]. Two servers are connected to each other if they are located either at the same row and consecutive columns or at the same column and consecutive rows. In other words, Server[i][j] and Server[i-1][j] are connected to each other for all i and j such that 2 ≤ i ≤ N and 1 ≤ j ≤ N. Also Server[i][j] and Server[i][j-1] are connected to each other for all i and j such that 1 ≤ i ≤ N and 2 ≤ j ≤ N. Aliens had divided the Data File with the data about the Birth of the Human beings into N * N parts denoted as F[i][j] (1 ≤ i, j ≤ N) and placed the part F[i][j] at the Server[i][j]. Each server has a password which is some non-negative integer. Chef Po needs to crack all the servers in order to get all parts of the Data File. Aliens are really strange beings so they single out three types of passwords: Prime Password, which is the prime number. The list of prime numbers starts as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, . Even Password, which is the even non-prime number. This list starts as 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, . Note, that we exclude 2 since it is a prime. Odd Password, which is the odd non-prime number. This list starts as 1, 9, 15, 21, 25, 27, 33, 35, 39, 45, 49, . So it is the list of all odd positive numbers where primes are excluded.For simplicity we call server secured by the Even Password as Even Server. Similarly we define notion of Odd Server and Prime Server. Each Odd or Even server has a friendly screen with the color indicator. Assume that you enter the password trying to guess the actual password at this server. Then indicator will become green if you enter the number which is smaller than the actual password, it will become red if your number is greater than the actual password or you will get the access to the server (and, thus, to the needed part of the Data File) if the password is correct. On the other hand, each Prime Server has no such screen and the only way to crack it is to try all prime numbers until you find out the correct password. So our Chef simply iterate over the list of primes in increasing order and try them until he finds the correct password. Probably most of you think that to crack servers with friendly screen Chef Po will use binary search. But he is quite weird Hacker and doesn't know this concept. To crack server with the friendly screen he will use the following strategy. He will try all even numbers starting from 0 (even number 2) until he either finds the correct password or the indicator becomes red which automatically would mean that the password is odd and equals to the K-1 where K is the even number that was entered at last. So he enters K-1 in the latter case and get the access to the server. Let's consider some examples. Let the password be 4. It is an Even Password so Chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is either Even or Odd. Hence he will try passwords in the order 0, 2, 4 making 2 unsuccessful tries. Let the password be 9. It is an Odd Password so again Chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is either Even Server or Odd Server. Hence he will try passwords in the order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9 making 6 unsuccessful tries. Note that after he enters 8 the indicator becomes green indicating that the password is greater than 8, on the other hand, after he enters 10 the indicator becomes red indicating that the password is less than 10. Since the only integer number greater than 8 and less than 10 is 9 he will enter it at the last step getting the access to the server. Finally, let the password be 11. It is a Prime Password so Chef will not see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is Prime Server. Hence he will try passwords in the order 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 making 4 unsuccessful tries.The Alien Data Center has very interesting vulnerability, that Chef has noticed by analyzing Alien's secured correspondence. If Chef crack some Even Server S then all Even Servers connected to S become cracked as well, and all Even Servers connected to these servers also become cracked and so on. More formally, the Even Server S' becomes cracked if it is connected with S via possibly other Even Servers. That is, there exists a sequence of Even Servers such that each two consecutive servers in this sequence are connected, the first server is S and the last server is S'. Chef calls this vulnerability as ""Grid Hacking Mechanism"". The same is true for Odd Servers. By it is no longer true for Prime Servers. So each Prime Server should be cracked individually. Now the final tactic for Chef is the following. He will consider the servers in row-major order. That is, at first he consider servers of the first row in the order Server[1][1], Server[1][2], ., Server[1][N]. Then he considers servers of the second row in the order Server[2][1], Server[2][2], ., Server[2][N] and so on until he reaches the last server in the last row (which is the Master Server). For each server he at first check whether it is already cracked by the ""Grid Hacking Mechanism"". If yes then he gathers the corresponding part of the Data File and move on. Otherwise he checks for the friendly screen at this server and apply one of the cracking tactics described above. That is, when he sees the friendly screen he will enter even numbers starting from zero until he finds the password in the way described above. After that he gathers the corresponding part of the Data File and also some other servers become cracked by the ""Grid Hacking Mechanism"". And when he doesn't see the screen he will enter prime numbers in increasing order until he finds the password. After that he again gathers the corresponding part of the Data File but no other servers become cracked since ""Grid Hacking Mechanism"" does not work for Prime Servers. Finally he will reach the Master Server, crack it and gather the last part of the Data File.But the only way to recombine the original file is to use special Alien utility called winripzar on the Master Server. It also has the password. Chef Po is a great hacker, so he found out using his special skills that the password for winripzar equals to the number of unsuccessful tries used by him to crack all the servers in the Data Center. After cracking all the servers and gathering all the parts of the Data File Chef became so happy that forgot the number of unsuccessful tries he made during this cracking marathon. But he noted down passwords for all the servers and now asks you for help. Calculate the number of unsuccessful tries Chef did during cracking of all the servers and let him save the Earth!

Chefland Army ,"This is not intended to be the tie-break problem. In the Chefland army, there are M generals (numbered 1 through M) and N soldiers (numbered 1 through N). The Army has a vertical hierarchy ― a soldier may command many other soldiers (including zero), but each soldier has at most one commander. A soldier y is a subordinate of a soldier x if soldier x is the commander of soldier y or there is a soldier z commanded by soldier x such that soldier y is a subordinate of soldier z. No soldier is commanded by one of their subordinates because every soldier is feared by all of his subordinates. Moreover, all soldiers are subordinates of soldier 1. Let's denote the commander of soldier i by pipip_i (p1=0p1=0p_1 = 0 since soldier 1 cannot have a commander). As in any organisation, the generals have some soldiers they hate. If a general meets a soldier whom he hates, this general becomes angry for the rest of the day. The soldiers should be paid some wages over one or more days. For each valid i, soldier i should be paid SiSiS_i chefcoins. Shyam is in charge of this; he should choose an integer D (0≤D≤N20≤D≤N20 le D le N^2) and during each of the next D days, perform the following process: Choose an integer K and K soldiers, then call these soldiers to report their feats to the generals. Shyam is very careful ― on each day, he chooses these soldiers in such a way that there are no two called soldiers where one is afraid of the other (in other words, no called soldier is a subordinate of another called soldier). Choose a positive real number R and give each of the called soldiers R chefcoins. For each soldier v and general u, if soldier v was called and is hated by general u, then general u becomes angry. Let G be the total number of angry generals on this day. Then, the total angriness of the generals increases by G⋅RG⋅RG cdot R. Before the start of the next day, the generals that were angry calm down and are not angry anymore (so they can become angry again). Help Shyam pay the soldiers while minimising the total angriness of the generals over all D days.

Tywins Tactics ,"Tywin Lannister is a tactical genius. At the heart of his tactical skills, is the way he has organized his armies, and the way he is able to estimate his soldiers' skill-levels, thus helping him make crucial decisions as to whom to dispatch to which areas of the war. His army is organized in the form of a hierarchy - indeed it is a tree, with him as the root. We say ""A has immediate superior B"" if A reports directly to B. We further say ""A has superior B"" if there is a chain of soldiers starting with A, ending with B, and where each soldier reports directly to the next soldier of the chain. Further, each soldier is assigned an initial skill-level based on prior experience and battle proficiency. In order for Tywin to decide whom to send to which battle, he has the following scheme: He chooses a particular soldier S as the leader of his temporary 'regiment', and sends in to battle, S as well as all the soldiers that have S as one of their superiors. He estimates the skill level of the regiment as the total skill level of all the soldiers under S (denoted by query ""Q S""). After a battle, he may want to update the skill levels of some soldiers. If he wants to update the skill level of soldier S to value x, it is denoted by the query ""U S x"". You are given the structure of the army, whose size is N, the initial skill levels of all the individual soldiers, as well the number of queries M. For each query of the type ""Q S"", report the sum of skill-levels of all the soldiers who have S as their superior. Note: The soldiers are numbered 1 to N, and Tywin is given the number 1.

Obviously, Chef Thanos does not want to leave any edges colourless, but he immediately realised that in such a case, it generally may be impossible to make the graph perfectly balanced, so he decided to colour some of the edges yellow instead, so that it is always possible. Since Chef Thanos hates the colour yellow, his satisfaction with the graph will be greater when he uses fewer yellow edges. Can you help him choose how to colour the edges so that you remain in the surviving half of humanity?

Sort the Leaves ,"You are given a binary tree with N vertices numbered 1 through N. The root of the tree is vertex 1. There are two types of vertices: non-leaf: has exactly two sons — a left son and a right son leaf: doesn't have sons, but it has an integer value Let's denote the number of leaves by L. It is guaranteed that the values of all leaves are pairwise distinct numbers between 1 and L inclusive. To each leaf, we can assign a string in the following way: consider the simple path 1=v1,v2,…,vl1=v1,v2,…,vl1=v_1, v_2, dots, v_l from the root to leaf vlvlv_l the string SvlSvlS_{v_l} assigned to leaf vlvlv_l has length l−1l−1l-1; for each valid i, SiSiS_i is 'L' if vi+1vi+1v_{i+1} is the left son of viviv_i or 'R' if it's the right son of viviv_i It's clear that these strings are all pairwise distinct. Let's call the tree leaf-sorted if the following property holds for every pair of different leaves a,ba,ba, b: SaSaS_a is lexicographically smaller than SbSbS_b if and only if the value of a is smaller than the value of b. You are allowed to perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (including zero): choose a non-leaf vertex and swap the edges to its left and right son. That is, the original left son of this vertex becomes the right son and the original right son becomes the left son (along with their whole subtrees). Find the minimum number of operations needed to make the tree leaf-sorted, or determine that it's impossible.

Doofish Set ,"Dr.D has invented yet another -inator: the hateinator. He wants to test it on a group of N people (numbered 1 through N). The hateinator may be used any number of times; to use it once, Dr.D should divide these N people into two groups and press the fire button on the hateinator. We call each such grouping a Doofish set. Afterwards, there will be hatred between each two people who were in different groups. The hatred does not disappear ― any two people that hate each other before the hateinator is used still hate each other afterwards. The hateinator uses a lot of power. Let's denote the number of times it is used by K. Then, it consumes K⋅NK⋅NK cdot N units of power. Dr.D cannot afford to use the hateinator if this number exceeds 10610610^6. Dr.D has done the math and computed the most evil hatred system: a situation with some M pairs of people who hate each other. You are given these pairs. There must not be any other pair of people who hate each other. Initially, there is no hatred between these N people. Now, Dr.D is wondering: is it possible to use the hateinator to create this most evil system? If it is, what is the minimum number of times he needs to use it and with which Doofish sets?

Naruto Run ,"Naruto wants to visit N villages. Since he is busy, he will be sending his clones instead. He can make as many clones as he wants. In fact, his clones can also make clones. In particular, two villages are connected if there is a path in between them. Each village has a number between 1 to N (inclusive). They are connected by paths. The whole network of village is in the form of a tree with its root being village 1. On the first day, Naruto sends a clone to village 1. The clone stays there for the day and on the next day, it multiplies into K clones, where K is equal to the number of unvisited villages connected to the current villages the clone is in. Then, 1 clone is sent to each of the unvisited villages. The process is repeated for each village until all villages are visited. If no unvisited villages are connected to a village, then the clone simply disappears after paying the visit. Assume that it takes no time in making clones and going from 1 village to other. The clones take energy from the real Naruto so he would want to be prepared for the day when the number of clones will be maximum. Help him find this day.

The top left cell of the maze is the start and the bottom right one is the goal. All walkable cells are initially white. Cell B is reachable from cell A iff A and B are both walkable and it's possible to get to B by starting at A and moving only to walkable cells in the four cardinal directions — up, right, down and left. The maze is complicated and you're too lazy. That's why you try to solve it using the following algorithm: Pick a white walkable cell at random and click on it. The cell you picked in the first step and all cells reachable from it turn red. If there's a red path from the start to the goal, you have solved the maze. Else: goto first step. (Note that once a cell turns red, it will remain red until the maze is solved. Also note that this algorithm will always terminate.)

Palindromeness ,"Let us define the palindromeness of a string in the following way: If the string is not a palindrome, its' palindromeness is zero. The palindromeness of an one-letter string is 1. The palindromness of a string S of the length greater than one is 1 + ""palindromeness of the string that is formed by the first [|S|/2] symbols of S"". Let us consider some examples for better understanding: The palindromeness of the string zxqfd is 0, since the string is not a palindrome. The palindromeness of the string a is 1, by definition. The palindromeness of the string aa is 2, beucase for ""aa"" we get 1 + palindromeness of ""a"", that is one, so we get 2. The palindromeness of the string abacaba is 3. You are given a string S.

However, not all seeds are equal - some seeds are good, some are bad. Seeds can be one of 4 types - {−2,−1,1,2}{−2,−1,1,2}{-2, -1, 1, 2}. Ashok goes to the farmer's market to buy some seeds where he meets Uday, an eccentric rich merchant. Ashok doesn't have enough money to buy all the seeds he can plant. Taking pity on him, Uday proposes a strange game. Uday sets out N seeds out in a pattern resembling a tree. Ashok can then choose one simple path in this tree and take every seed along this path. The path must not be empty, i.e, it should contain at least one vertex of the tree. The total yield of the seeds Ashok receives equals the product of all their types. Given this tree and the type of seed placed at each vertex, what is the maximum yield Ashok can obtain? The answer can be large, so print it modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7.

Closest Points ,"Crisis at Byte Town! There have been 1000 (of course, in base 2) instances of bank robberies in the past month! That is, more than one robbery in a day in average and the Byte Town Police Department (BTPD) is dumb founded. Chef, the honorable President of Byte Town, has pledged to solve the problem for good. Chef investigated and found out that Byte Town has a large number of BTPD response centers and an equally large (if not larger) number of banks. Each bank has an alert mechanism that alerts a BTPD response center assigned to the bank. That response center is then responsible for sending in a strike team. The response center assigned to some bank is called the respondent for this bank. Unfortunately, that is the problem. The current assignment of which BTPD response center responds to an alert by a bank is outdated. Chef has decided to upgrade this system, in lieu of which, you have to solve this problem. Byte Town, being the quintessential challenge for every programmer, is Euclidean 3D space. Each response center and each bank is represented by some point in this 3D space. There are N response centers and Q banks in Byte Town. BTPD response centers are labeled by integers 0, 1, ., N-1 and ith response center is represented by the point with coordinates (Xi, Yi, Zi). Banks are labeled by integers 0, 1, ., Q-1 and jth bank is represented by the point with coordinates (Aj, Bj, Cj). No two buildings (banks, as well as response centers) will ever be at the same point. Your task is to assign for each bank the BTPD response center that will be the respondent for this bank. A response center can be the respondent for more than one bank. But every bank should have exactly one respondent. Bluntly speaking, your goal is to minimize the Euclidian distance between bank and its respondent. The Euclidian distance between ith response center and jth bank is equal to the square root of the number (Xi – Aj)2 + (Yi – Bj)2 + (Zi – Cj)2. Denote by C[j] the closest response center to the jth bank and by D[j] the distance to it. Your absolute goal is to find C[j] for all banks. But since it is the challenge problem you can get accepted even if your assignment will be not optimal. But to get accepted you need to find C[j] for at least one value of j. To make things clear we note that C[j] could be not unique, so by the phrase ""to find C[j]"" we mean to find any response center that has distance D[j] to the jth bank.

Wireless Electricity (Challenge) ,"Ada is in charge of upgrading Chefland's electrical network — she is implementing wireless electricity! For simplicity, let's consider Chefland a two-dimensional world, where the cities are represented by points on a plane and electric wires (which are not necessarily connecting the cities) are represented by straight line segments. There are N cities in Chefland (numbered 1 through N) and M wires (numbered 1 through M). For each valid i, the position of the i-th city is (Xi,Yi)(Xi,Yi)(X_i, Y_i). Also, for each valid i, the i-th wire is a line segment with endpoints (Ai,Bi)(Ai,Bi)(A_i, B_i) and (Ci,Di)(Ci,Di)(C_i, D_i) initially. In order to transmit power, Ada built two plates (line segments): the positive plate, which has endpoints (−1,0)(−1,0)(-1, 0) and (0,−1)(0,−1)(0, -1), and the negative plate, which has endpoints (106+1,106)(106+1,106)(10^6+1, 10^6) and (106,106+1)(106,106+1)(10^6, 10^6 + 1). A wire is positive if it intersects the positive plate or intersects another wire about which we already know that it is positive. Similarly, a wire is negative if it intersects the negative plate or another negative wire. It is not allowed for any wire to be both positive and negative, because that creates a short-circuit. For each valid i, let SiSiS_i be the minimum of distances of the i-th city from endpoints of positive wires, and let TiTiT_i be the minimum of its distances from endpoints of negative wires. Then, the cost of transmitting electricity to the i-th city is S2i+T2iSi2+Ti2S_i^2 + T_i^2. Let P be the sum of these costs over all cities. You are allowed to move the wires, but not to rotate them. For each valid i, the cost of moving the i-th segment by hihih_i units horizontally and viviv_i units vertically from its original position is h2i+v2ihi2+vi2h_i^2 + v_i^2. After such a move, the endpoints of the segment become (Ai+hi,Bi+vi)(Ai+hi,Bi+vi)(A_i + h_i, B_i + v_i) and (Ci+hi,Di+vi)(Ci+hi,Di+vi)(C_i + h_i, D_i + v_i). Let Q be the sum of costs of moving all the wires. Your goal is to move the wires and make P+QP+QP + Q as small as possible. In the final network of wires, there should be at least one positive wire, at least one negative wire, and no wire should be both positive and negative. However, it is allowed to have some wires that are neither positive nor negative. Tags: alei, geometry, heuristic, march21, tie-breaker ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/WIREL,CC

In this problem, you will be asked to classify some triangles according to their sides and angles. According to their measure, angles may be: Acute — an angle that is less than 90 degrees Right — a 90-degrees angle Obtuse — an angle that is greater than 90 degrees According to their sides, triangles may be: Scalene — all sides are different Isosceles — exactly two sides are equal According to their angles, triangles may be: Acute — all angles are acute Right — one angle is right Obtuse — one angle is obtuse Triangles with three equal sides (equilateral triangles) will not appear in the test data. The triangles formed by three collinear points are not considered in this problem. In order to classify a triangle, you should use only the adjactives from the statement.

Initially, ANSWER is equal to 0. You will be given X', Y' and N' instead of the real values of X, Y and N. To get the real data you should perform the following computations: X = X' xor ANSWER; Y = Y' xor ANSWER; N = N' xor ANSWER.

Ciel and Map ,"Tomya is a girl. She loves Chef Ciel very much. Tomya writes a tetragon (see the below Notes 1 for details) in her map. The map has N points, whose coordinate are (Xi, Yi), denoting Ciel's restaurants. Each vertex of the tetragon written by Tomya is one of the Ciel's restaurants. Tomya doesn't show her tetragon in the map, but she says that she draws a long segment. To guess her tetragon, please tell the maximum length of a segment which can be one of the sides in her tetragon. (See Notes 2 for the definition of length) Notes 1: A tetragon means a polygon with 4 sides. A tetragon must be simple, that is, the boundary of the tetragon does not cross itself. A tetragon does not have to be convex. Notes 2: The length of a segment is defined as the Euclidean distance between the endpoints. That is, the length of the segment (x1, y1) - (x2, y2) is the square root of (x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2.

Folding Paper ,"Chef has a rectangular piece of paper. He puts it on a big board in such a way that two sides of the paper are horizontal and two are vertical, and then he performs a sequence of N operations. You are given a string S with length N; for each valid i, the i-th character of S determines the type of the i-th operation: 'R': Pick up the paper from the right side and fold it onto the left side. 'L': Pick up the paper from the left side and fold it onto the right side. 'U': Pick up the paper from the upper side and fold it onto the bottom side. 'D': Pick up the paper from the bottom side and fold it onto the upper side. The paper is folded in such a way that there is still a flat rectangular sheet of paper lying on the table after each operation, but it consists of multiple layers of the original sheet. The lengths of the horizontal and vertical sides of the resulting sheet (after performing these N operations) are W and H respectively. Let's build an Euclidean coordinate system on the paper, where the point (0,0)(0,0)(0, 0) corresponds to the bottom left corner and (W,H)(W,H)(W, H) to the upper right corner. Chef then draws M points on this folded sheet of paper. The ink used to draw them soaks deep into the paper, so each point is drawn on all layers of the paper (and also on both faces of each layer). Finally, Chef completely unfolds the paper. He's asking you to compute the distance between the nearest pair of points.

Robots in Chefland ,"Chefland is a big city which consists of infinite number of junctions on a 2D plane. The junctions are depicted below and they form a hexagonal grid — they satisfy the following conditions: Two of the junctions have coordinates (0,0)(0,0)(0,0) and (1,0)(1,0)(1,0). Each junction J is connected by line segments with six other junctions. These junctions are the vertices of a regular hexagon with side length 1 and their distances from J are also all equal to 1. Chef created a robot that can traverse the junctions. Initially, it is in some junction and oriented towards another junction which is connected to it by a line segment. The robot accepts a string of instructions — decimal digits 0 through 5. It executes the instructions one by one and stops after executing the final instruction. When the robot executes an instruction denoted by a digit d, it first rotates by 60⋅d60⋅d60 cdot d degrees counterclockwise and then moves 1 unit forward, to the junction it is oriented towards. Chef wants to test the robot, so he wrote a string S of N instructions. You should answer Q queries. In each query, Chef wants to give the robot a substring of instructions SL,SL+1,…,SRSL,SL+1,…,SRS_L, S_{L+1}, ldots, S_R; the robot starts in the junction (0,0)(0,0)(0, 0) and it is oriented towards (1,0)(1,0)(1, 0). You should find the final position (the x- and y-coordinates) of the robot.

A New Door ,"Now Chef is very good in cooking; his dishes are the best in the city, so he wants to make his restaurant prettier. The first, what customer sees, when comes to his restaurant is the door. So he will start with it. He has found a new design last night. Hi will cut out some circles from the door and fill the holes by the glass to make windows of peculiar form. Formally, we can model the process Chef will perform to create the windows as follows. Let the door be a rectangle at the coordinate plane with corners at the points (0, 0), (W, 0), (0, H), (W, H). Initially the door is colored white, while the remaining part of the coordinate plane is colored black. At each step Chef colors in black some circle including all its inner points. After Chef will color all required circles, the black part of the door (that is, black regions that lie in the rectangle corresponding to the door) is cut out and replaced by the glass. The main measure of peculiarity of the door is the perimeter of all the windows considering only those parts of windows borders lying inside the door (see example case 2 for clarity). Chef is very tired after coloring so many circles and asks you to find this number. Tags: Geometry Mathematics ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/ANDOOR,CC
Sasha and Photos ,"Sasha is a little girl who likes to view and compare photos. In this problem, a photo is a grid of pixels with h rows and w columns; each cell of this grid is either black or white. We will call the ordered pair of integers (h,w)(h,w)(h, w) the shape of a photo. Let's define the similarity of two photos P and R with the same shape (h,w)(h,w)(h, w) as the number of pairs of indices i,ji,ji, j (1≤i≤h1≤i≤h1 le i le h, 1≤j≤w1≤j≤w1 le j le w) such that Pi,j=Ri,jPi,j=Ri,jP_{i, j} = R_{i, j}. Today, Sasha found two photos with possibly different shapes. She cannot directly compute the similarity of these photos; therefore, she decided to upscale both photos to get two photos with identical shapes. Formally, Sasha can choose two positive integers a and b and transform a photo with shape (h,w)(h,w)(h, w) into a photo with shape (ah,bw)(ah,bw)(ah, bw), where each pixel from the original photo is replaced by a rectangle of pixels with shape (a,b)(a,b)(a, b) and the same color as that pixel. Since Sasha does not like huge photos, the upscaled photos should be as small as possible (specifically, if the original photos have the same shapes, they should not be changed at all). Since the resulting photos may be very big, Sasha asks you to help her and compute their similarity.

Taxi Making Sharp Turns ,"Taxis of Kharagpur are famous for making sharp turns.

You have to identify whether the taxi made a sharp turn somewhere or not (Please look at Output section for details). If it made a sharp turn, also identify whether it is possible to change the coordinates at one of the N moments to make sure that the taxi doesn't make any sharp turn.

Wall ,"The is a massive wall over 700 feet high and is made of ice, stretching 300 miles across the northern border of the Seven Kingdoms, separating it from the wild lands beyond. Appearing as one of the nine Wonders Made by Man in the book by Lomas Longstrider, the is defended and held by the Sworn Brothers of the Night's Watch, who patrol and guard the castles from the Frostfangs mountain range in the west to the Bay of Seals in the east. (c) A Wiki of Ice and Fire Winter is coming. The army of White Walkers is heading to the south. The is the only obstacle, that protects the people of the Seven Kingdoms from the danger. In this problem we assume, that the can be described as a rectangle R on the Cartesian plane. The corner points of R are (0, 0), (0, H), (W, H) and (W, 0). In order to reinforce the Wall, the brothers of the Night's Watch have placed a huge simple polygonal chain P made of the purest valyrian steel on the wall. P can be desribed as following: P consists of N points, both coordinates of which are integers; The points are indexed with integers from 0 to N - 1; X-coordinate of i'th point of P equals to Xi; Y-coordinate of i'th point of P equals to: 0, if i is even; H, if i is odd. X0 equals to 0; Xi < Xi + 1 for 0 ≤ i < N - 1; XN - 1 equals to W. Your task is pretty simple: calculate the area of R, which is lying under P. Let's consider a small example for your better understanding: Let's define H = 4, W = 6, N = 3, X0 = 0, X1 = 5, X2 = 6. In this testcase we are interested in caculating the area of the green triangle. N can be extremely huge in this problem, so it's impossible to give you array X itself. Instead of this, we will provide some additional variables and arrays, with a help of which you will be able to generate array X inside your program. We will use additional integer variables M, A, B and IND. Also, additional array D, which consists of M integers and is indexed with integers from 0 to M - 1 will be used. Here's a pseudocode, which generates array X: X[0] = 0 for i from 1 to N - 1: begin X[i] = X[i - 1] + D[IND] IND = (A * IND + B) % M end Note Maybe, some of you aren't familiar with definitions from the statement.

Needles and Pins ,"Few people know that the Chef is also a modern artist. In his spare time, he makes paintings which do not stink of traditions. They are like whiffs of fresh air, full of experimentation. So, now you know all those err.. beautiful pieces of art in the Chef’s restaurant, are his own works! Here is how he makes a piece of modern art - First he takes a large thin wooden board. Then he draws a big polygon on it, using crayons. Then in several wild swings, he draws several lines on the board. You may think it is simple, but it is not so. After so many years of experience in slicing potatoes and tomatoes he has become very accurate in marking points on the board. So what is remarkable is, that every corner of the polygon, and every starting and ending point of the line is an integral point, i.e can be represented as <x, y> where x and y both are integers. Another point worth pointing out is that Chef believes in symmetry. This is visible from following fact- ""If we divide entire wooden board into 16 square shaped (virtual) regions, the difference in number of lines contained in the region with maximum lines and the region with minimum lines does not exceed 50%"". A region is said to contain a line if at least one end point of line is inside it. It doesn't end here. Then the Chef takes colourful (sewing) needles and nails them on every point on the line traced by crayon, such that the point is integral and it lies either on or inside the polygon. As polygon boundaries are also lines, needles are pinned on them as well. Finally he takes board pins with colourful heads and pins them inside the polygon such that the point is not already occupied by needle and the point is integral. Lo and behold! The painting is ready! The needles and board pins are rather costly, so the Chef neither wants to buy the needles and pins in excess, nor does he want to run short of them. Now, he needs your help to tell him the exact number of needles and pins that he would require. We can hear the Chef singing “..and still it begins, needles and pins ♪♫.” slowly.

(NOTE : The rupee will always strictly be a non-negative integer only). So Sachin and Sakshi want to exchange with rupees in such a way that they will buy the maximum possible number of food items. so among all possible ways to buy the maximum possible number of food items find such a way that minimizes the number of rupees one can share with other. Your job is to print the Minimum number of rupees one will share with other to buy the maximum number of food items.

Rearrange the gifts ,"It's Christmas time, Santa's friends are helping him to arrange the gifts. Franklin is a new member of Santa's group and he too help the others in arranging the gifts. Let n be the number of gifts. Santa has a unique technique of ordering ,he put a number on each gift and then he write the order of the gifts on a piece of paper and give it to his friends .But Franklin being a new member does not know about this technique so he arrange the gifts haphazardly without maintaining the order. But then one of the other member told him about this technique. Franklin finds himself in deep trouble and asks for your help. You are given the order of the gifts that Santa has given on the paper and also the order by which Franklin arranges the gifts.

Average Median Game ,"You are given an array A[1……N] of length N.Your task is to find the number of K length subarrays such that average of the subarray is greater than or equal to the median value of that subarray in sorted format. Also the median and average must both be prime or non prime. Median of an even length subarray would be the value at the smaller index of the two. For eg: Median of {2,3,4,5} would be 3, not 4. Consider the integer(floored) value of average for calculations. You have to answer T independent test cases. INPUT FORMAT: First line contains the length of the array N and length of subarray K. Second line contains the elements of the array A[i]. OUTPUT FORMAT: Print the count(>=0) of K length subarrays following the above condition. CONSTRAINTS: 1<=T<=10 1<=N<=10^5 1<=K<=N 2<=A[i]<=10^5 SAMPLE INPUT: 1 5 3 2 4 3 5 6 SAMPLE OUTPUT: 2 EXPLANATION: N = 5, K = 3 First subarray : {2,4,3} in sorted format is {2,3,4}. Therefore median is 3 and average is (2+4+3)/3 = 3. Hence median and average are both prime and average >= median. So count is increased by one. Second subarray : {4,3,5} in sorted format is {3,4,5}. Therefore median is 4 and average is (4+3+5)/3 = 4. Hence median and average are both non prime and average >= median. So count is increased by one. Third subarray : {3,5,6} in sorted format is {3,5,6}. Therefore median is 5 and average is (3+5+6)/3 = 4. Hence average < median so count is not increased.

Teaming in Tournament of Power ,"This is an Interactive problem Zeno sama hosted a Martial arts competition between 121212 universes in which the twin universes will be teaming together to fight. To participate in the tournament you must have exactly k fighters from your team. Beerus from Universe 7 and Champa from Universe 6 are teaming together and choose you as the manager of their team. You have total N fighters after combining Universe 6 & 7 numberd from 1−N1−N1-N , from which you have to choose k fighters. Now to win the tournament, your team of k should consist of more fighters from Universe 7 compared to Universe 6 as universe 7 is strong. NOTE: There should be at least one fighter from each universe You know that to build the team you should know the count of fighters from Universe 7 and Universe 6, and to get that you can ask 2 types of Queries to beerus,Asking too much queries can cost you HAKAI from beerus which can destroy you, so you can ask maximum Q queries of Type-1 and F queries of Type-2. The Queries are given below: For Type-1 query you give i and j as index of fighters and beerus will reply id ithithi^{th} and jthjthj^{th} fighter are of same universe or not. For Type-2 query you give i as an index of fighter and beerus will reply with the universe tow which that ithithi^{th} fighter belong to. After processing queries, you should find the probability of making such team which can win the tournament. The probability can be represented as P/QP/QP/Q you have to calculate P∗Q−1P∗Q−1P*Q^{-1} modmodmod (109+7)(109+7)(10^9+7), Where Q−1Q−1Q^{-1} is the modular multiplicative inverse of Q (mod(mod(mod (109+7))(109+7))(10^9+7)) Interaction First, your program should read a line containing a single integer ― the number of test cases T. The description of interaction for T test cases follows. Read the first line of each test case that contains two space-separated integers N and K denoting number of fighters after combining both the universes and number of fighters required in a team Now for each test case you may ask queries as below Type-1 : To ask this type of query print a line containing the character 'Q' a space and two space-separated integers i and j (1≤i,j≤N1≤i,j≤N1 leq i,j leq N and i≠ji≠ji neq j),denoting the indexes of fighters.After this you should read one int which is the response from beerus, If both are from the same universe Beerus will reply with '1' else he will reply with '0' Type-2 : To ask this type of query print a line containing the character 'F' a space and an integer i denoting the index of fighter,After this you should read one int which is 6 or 7 ,the Universe to which the ithithi^{th} fighter belong to. When you think you got the probability you should print a line containing a character 'A' and your probability in the form of P∗Q−1P∗Q−1P*Q^{-1} modmodmod (109+7)(109+7)(10^9+7) space separated.

The Lead Game ,"The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our purposes this is sufficient. The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds have been played, the total score of each player is determined by adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher total score is declared the winner. The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the end of any round in the game is declared the winner. Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds: Round Player 1 Player 2 1 140 82 2 89 134 3 90 110 4 112 106 5 88 90 The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after each round for this game is given below: Round Player 1 Player 2 Leader Lead 1 140 82 Player 1 58 2 229 216 Player 1 13 3 319 326 Player 2 7 4 431 432 Player 2 1 5 519 522 Player 2 3 Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores. The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58 at the end of round 1) during the game. Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will always be a single winner. That is, there are no ties.

Football ,"A football competition has just finished. The players have been given points for scoring goals and points for committing fouls. Now, it is up to Alex to find the best player in the tournament. As a programmer, your job is to help Alex by telling him the highest number of points achieved by some player. You are given two sequences A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,ANA_1, A_2, ldots, A_N and B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BNB_1, B_2, ldots, B_N. For each valid i, player i scored AiAiA_i goals and committed BiBiB_i fouls. For each goal, the player that scored it gets 202020 points, and for each foul, 101010 points are deducted from the player that committed it. However, if the resulting number of points of some player is negative, this player will be considered to have 0 points instead. You need to calculate the total number of points gained by each player and tell Alex the maximum of these values. Tags: Implementation Algorithms ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/MSNSADM1,CC

Closing the Tweets ,"Little kids, Jack and Evan like playing their favorite game Glass-and-Stone. Today they want to play something new and came across Twitter on their father's laptop. They saw it for the first time but were already getting bored to see a bunch of sentences having at most 140 characters each. The only thing they liked to play with it is, closing and opening tweets. There are N tweets on the page and each tweet can be opened by clicking on it, to see some statistics related to that tweet. Initially all the tweets are closed. Clicking on an open tweet closes it and clicking on a closed tweet opens it. There is also a button to close all the open tweets. Given a sequence of K clicks by Jack, Evan has to guess the total number of open tweets just after each click. Please help Evan in this game.

He uses one ingredient jar for each type of ingredient and when he stops using a jar, he does not want to use it again later while preparing the same recipe, so ingredients of each type (which is used in his recipe) always appear as a contiguous subsequence. Chef is innovative, too, so he makes sure that in each of his recipes, the quantity of each ingredient (i.e. the number of occurrences of this type of ingredient) is unique ― distinct from the quantities of all other ingredients.

Logging in the computer ,"Finally the LazyProblemSetters have decided the way in which they will attempt the questions in the problem set. They have decided to go to the Computer Lab of the CSE department (because it has air-conditioning) and are ready to get their hands dirty with some WA's and TLE's. Their department has a very unique lab. They have a lot of computers and each student gets a private account which they can access through any of those computers. For this, no data is stored on these computers but on dedicated servers and sent to the computer that a student is currently using. This way the students are not forced to sit on particular computers and can choose any place they like that is available. Now, the department has a home built advanced facial recognition software which they use in this lab. It works as follows:When anyone sits on a computer, his/her picture is captured, (along with the locality) and sent to the internal database of the lab where they identify the user associated with that picture, and the computer he/she is sitting. After that the data of that user is fetched from the dedicated data servers and sent to the computer. Now, all this takes time, and to keep the user busy, they decided to give them a puzzle to solve. If the user solves the puzzle correctly, they are allowed to login. The puzzle is as follows: A string S (composed of only small case letters of the English alphabet) is shown on the screen to the user. Then two integers P and Q are shown to the users. The user has now to create a string R using S and P by concatenating P copies of S one after another. Then R is transformed into its smallest lexicographic permutation i.e. all the ""a""'s are brought to the front and placed there, then after that all the ""b""'s are placed, then ""c""'s and so on. This is the final R that the user needs to form. Then Q numbers appear on the screen one by one. For each number N that appears on the screen, the user has to type the character at the Nth location of R. If N is greater than the length of R, they have to type ""-1"" (without quotes).

After many hours of hard work, the network seems ready and our two heroes want to test it using a slightly complicated test framework. Their test consists of Q queries. Each query is actually a task (given as a point in the same 2D plane). This task has to be executed on some available CPU (of some server in the network). A CPU (of some server) is available if there is no task that currently runs on it. For example, if a task arrives at time 5 and is executed on a CPU with a processing time of 10 then the CPU is busy in [5..14] (i.e. it is again available at time 15). Any attempt to execute a task on a busy CPU will be punished with a network crash (and neither Chef nor Batman wants to reconfigure the whole network again). There is a cost associated with scheduling (and running) a task. Let's assume that we have a server, located at (a, b), with a CPU of processing time p. If you execute a task located at (x, y), then the cost will be euclid_distance((a, b), (x, y)) + p (which is the cost of sending the task to the server plus the time to actually run the task on the CPU). The test framework is not perfect and doesn't allow multiple tasks waiting to be executed at the same time (i.e. the network will receive another task only after all previous tasks have been scheduled and are running or have finished). We can say that the interaction between the testing framework and the network is interactive. Assigning a task to a (server, cpu) pair is a hard task so Batman and Chef want you to help them.

ChefTown Parade ,"ChefTown is the biggest city and the capital of ChefLand. There are N beautiful buildings: restaurants, museums, living houses with large kitchens and so on. Every building has its height. For every i (1<=i<=N) there is exactly one building with height i. The buildings are located in a single line from left to right. The height of ith building is H(i). The Mayor of ChefTown wants to organize a parade, where all great chefs will take part. A parade depends of its location. The location of a parade is a segment of consecutive buildings beginning near the building number L and ending near the building number R (1<=L<=R<=N). Any parade won't be interesting if it is not hold on an interesting segment of buildings. The segment of buildings is interesting if following are hold: Imagine, that we have a segment [L,R]. Let K=R-L+1 be the length of this segment, and B be a list of heights of the buildings that belong to this segment. Let's sort B in non-decreasing order. Segment [L,R] is interesting if B[i]-B[i-1]=1 for every i (2<=i<=K). Now the Mayor of ChefTown is interested how many ways to organize an interesting parade of length W for ChefTown citizens. Help him and find out the number of different parades of length W, which can be hold in the city. Two parades ([L1,R1] and [L2,R2]) are considered to be different, if L1≠L2 or R1≠R2.

Chef Restores an Array ,"Chef had an array A with length N, but some of its elements got lost. Now, each element of this array is either unknown (denoted by -1) or a positive integer not exceeding K. Chef decided to restore the array A by replacing each unknown element by a positive integer not exceeding K. However, Chef has M restrictions that must hold for the restored array. There are two types of restrictions: I L R, meaning that for each i such that L < i ≤ R, the condition Ai - Ai-1 = 1 should be satisfied. D L R, meaning that for each i such that L < i ≤ R, the condition Ai - Ai-1 = -1 should be satisfied. Chef would like to know the number of ways to restore the array while satisfying all restrictions, modulo 109+7.

Mystery Tree ,"This is an interactive problem. You are given a tree with N vertices (numbered 1 through N). Each vertex has a value; let's denote the value of vertex i by aiaia_i. Vertex v is a bad adjacent of vertex u if there is an edge between vertices u and v and avava_v is strictly greater than auaua_u. Your task is to find a vertex without any bad adjacent or determine that there is no such vertex. You do not know the values a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aNa_1, a_2, ldots, a_N, but you may ask up to 202020 questions. In each question, you should choose a vertex x; the grader responds with the number of some bad adjacent vertex of vertex x or with −1−1-1 if x does not have any bad adjacent. Interaction First, you should read a line containing a single integer — the number of test cases T. The description of interaction for T test cases follows. For each test case, first, you should read a line containing a single integer N. Then, you should read N−1N−1N-1 lines. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that vertices u and v are connected by an edge. Then, you may ask questions. To ask a question, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 1 and x (1≤x≤N1≤x≤N1 le x le N). Then, you should read a line containing a single integer y. If the question was invalid or if you asked too many questions, y=−2y=−2y = -2. If x has no bad adjacent, y=−1y=−1y = -1. Otherwise, y is the number of a bad adjacent of x. When you have determined the answer, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 2 and x. If there is no vertex without a bad adjacent, x should be −1−1-1; otherwise, x should be the number of a vertex without a bad adjacent. Finally, you should read a line containing a single integer: 1 if your answer is correct or −2−2-2 if it is incorrect. If your answer is correct, you should continue solving the remaining test cases. Note that when you receive −2−2-2 (either as the response to a question or to your answer), you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

And now he wants to make M operations with the tree, each of them is: During i-th operation Chef picks vertex Vi. If vertex Vi is black, then he colors it white. Chef finds the farthest white vertex from vertex Vi, in case of tie he picks the one with largest index. This vertex is the result of current operation. If vertex Vi wasn't recolored on step 2 of current operation (therefore before the operation it is white), Chef colors it black. Chef gives to you the tree and sequence V.

Each of the Titans is facing one of the four directions i.e., North, South, East, or West, represented by uppercase English letters 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W' respectively. A Titan can rotate on the spot where it is standing. It requires X units of energy to rotate 909090 degrees clockwise, and Y units of energy to rotate 909090 degrees anti-clockwise. For the activation of The Rumbling, all the Titans must face Eren Yeager. So, Eren wants to position himself on the West-East line (on which other Titans are standing). He can either stand to the left of all Titans, in between two consecutive Titans, or to the right of all Titans.

Chef's chessboard does not have to be a correct chessboard (in particular, it may have N≠MN≠MN neq M). A sub-board of Chef's chessboard is a rectangular piece of this board with an arbitrarily chosen top left and bottom right cell (possibly equal to the original chessboard).

Chef and Cycled Cycles ,"Chef recently learned about finding shortest paths in a bidirectional graph. He has following types of graphs with him and would like to find shortest paths between some given pair of vertices. There are N cycles in the graph. Let us enumerate them cycle number 1 to N. The i-th cycle contains Ai nodes enumerated from 1 to Ai. The nodes of a single cycle are connected to each other in cyclic fashion, i.e. the 1st node is connected to 2nd, 2nd to 3rd, and so on till the last node is connected to the 1st node. All of these edges are weighed. The cycles are also connected to each other via an edge in a similar cyclic order. The i-th cycle is connected to i % N + 1-th cycle via an edge. This edge is between some vertex v1 of i-th cycle and vertex v2 of i % N + 1-th cycle and is a weighted edge. You are given Q queries, each containing four integers v1, c1, v2, c2. You have to find the weight of shortest path between the v1-th vertex of c1-th cycle, and v2-th vertex of c2-th cycle.

Chef and Circle Run ,"Chef likes to play with graphs a lot. Today he created a graph in the following way. He first lays down N nodes in a circle. The nodes nodes are numbered from 1 to N, in the clockwise order, i.e. the node 2 is followed by 1, 3 is followed by 2, and 1 is followed by N. Two vertices are said to be adjacent if they don't have an intermediate vertex placed between them. There is an edge between each adjacent pair of vertices, so there are total N such edges. Each edge has an integer associated with it (may be negative). Chef wants to find a walk from node start to node end using the above described edges. Chef has to pay cost for each edge in the walk equal to the integer associated with the edge. He wants to minimize the total cost he will incur. Also, Chef does not like to move through an edge more than twice. Find out minimum cost that Chef has to pay. Note that a walk from a node u to v can contain repeated vertices in it.

Digit Longest Increasing Subsequences 2 ,"Recently Chef learned about Longest Increasing Subsequence. To be precise, he means longest strictly increasing subsequence, when he talks of longest increasing subsequence. To check his understanding, he took his favorite n-digit number and for each of its n digits, he computed the length of the longest increasing subsequence of digits ending with that digit. Then he stored these lengths in an array named LIS. For example, let us say that Chef's favourite 4-digit number is 1531, then the LIS array would be [1, 2, 2, 1]. The length of longest increasing subsequence ending at first digit is 1 (the digit 1 itself) and at the second digit is 2 ([1, 5]), at third digit is also 2 ([1, 3]), and at the 4th digit is 1 (the digit 1 itself).

A person will be satisfied after the journey, only if that person gets to use the charging station for the desired amount of time.

In order to schedule, you can pick any interval of time, say [L,R)[L,R)[L, R), and ask the person i to use the charging station from t=Lt=Lt = L and leave just before t=Rt=Rt = R. After this the person i would have spent R−LR−LR - L minutes on the charging station and any person who is still on the train can begin using the charging station starting from t=Rt=Rt = R. An interval scheduling will be a set of time intervals and people assigned to those intervals. A schedule is valid if: No two intervals in the schedule intersect each other.

Fault Tolerance ,"Chef has a set of very large set of very important data he doesn't want to lose. Chef has a number of servers on which he stores the data. To store the data, Chef begins by splitting his data into chunks. Then he assigns a set of chunks to each server. For the sake of redundancy, the same chunk may be assigned to multiple servers. If multiple chunks are assigned to the same server, there will not be enough space to store all of the chunks individually, so instead the chunks are combined together. When multiple chunks are combined together it is no longer possible to retrieve the data from the original chunks. However, by combining data from multiple servers it may be possible to retrieve the original data. Denote A ⊕ B as the result of combining chunks A and B. The following properties hold: A ⊕ B = B ⊕ A (A ⊕ B) ⊕ C = A ⊕ (B ⊕ C) (A ⊕ A) ⊕ B = B Note that the first two properties imply that when combining more than two chunks, the order in which they are combined does not matter. Let's consider an example (this example will coincide with the sample input below). There are 4 chunks of data, and 6 servers. Denote Ci (0 ≤ i < 4) as the original chunks of data, and Sj (0 ≤ j < 6) as the data stored on the servers. Chef combines chunks as follows: S0 = C2 S1 = C0 ⊕ C3 S2 = C0 ⊕ C2 S3 = C1 ⊕ C3 S4 = C0 ⊕ C1 ⊕ C2 S5 = C0 ⊕ C1 One way Chef may recover the original data is as follows: C0 = S0 ⊕ S2 C1 = S2 ⊕ S4 C2 = S0 C3 = S2 ⊕ S3 ⊕ S4 Chef is now interested in how safe his data is. If the data from some servers is lost it may be impossible to recover the original data. Chef would like you to find a set of servers such that simultaneous failure would make some part of his data irrecoverable.

When a different soldier is attacked, he does not try to defend and dies immediately. The power of the attacking soldier's sword does not change. Then, the next living soldier to the right of the current attacking soldier becomes the attacking soldier and the process continues until there is only one soldier left. It is clear that this way, Josh cannot be the last survivor. However, Chefland's general Chef plans to interrupt this process as soon as there are exactly two living soldiers of Bitland left (Josh wants to be one of them) by attacking them with Chefland's full firepower F. Since this attack is unexpected, both attacked soldiers try to defend independently with the weapons they have. Josh survives if the current defense power of his shield is at least F. Any other soldier survives only if the power of his sword is strictly greater than F. Since Chefland does not attack again, if both Josh and another soldier survive, then the other soldier will kill Josh. Therefore, Josh wants to be the only survivor of Chefland's attack. Your task is to find the minimum possible value of D such that Josh survives if he chooses his position P optimally (or determine that he cannot survive) and the lowest position P such that Josh survives if he takes a shield with this defense power D.

Sereja and Random Array ,"Sereja likes to generate pseudo random binary sequences. Now Sereja has two generators: one is a based on linear congruential generators (LCGs) and another is based on Xorshift. Sereja has some binary sequences generated in past times, and he wants to know which generator makes these sequences. You can know the details of Sereja's generators, then can you answer this problem? The following is the details. We may give the length N and a seed integer S to the generators, then they generate a binary sequence A[1], A[2], ., A[N]. The 1st generator works as follows (C++ code. If you are not familiar with C++, please see the below section Notes for C++): /* -- start here -*/ unsigned X; // we assume that unsigned is a 32bit integer type void srand1(unsigned S){ X = S; } unsigned nextInteger1(void){ X = X * 1103515245 + 12345; return (X / 65536) % 32768; } void generator1(int N, unsigned S, int A[]){ srand1(S); for(int i=1;i<=N;i++){ A[i] = nextInteger1() % 2; } } /* -- end here -*/ The 2nd generator works as follows (C++ code): /* -- start here -*/ unsigned x, y, z, w; // we assume that unsigned is a 32bit integer type void srand2(unsigned S){ x = S; y = x * S; z = y * S; w = z * S; } unsigned nextInteger2(void){ unsigned t = x ^ (x << 11); x = y; y = z; z = w; return w = (w ^ (w >> 19)) ^ (t ^ (t >> 8)); } void generator2(int N, unsigned S, int A[]){ srand2(S); for(int i=1;i<=N;i++){ A[i] = nextInteger2() % 2; } } /* -- end here -*/ Note that the LCG used in the 1st generator is the same one suggested in ISO/IEC 9899 (pp. 346--347), and Xorshift used in the 2nd generator is the same one in the paper by Marsaglia (July 2003).

Fenwick Iterations ,"Chef has just learned a new data structure - Fenwick tree. This data structure holds information about array of N elements and can process two types of operations: Add some value to ith element of the array Calculate sum of all elements on any prefix of the array Both operations take O(log N) time. This data structure is also well known for its low memory usage. To be more precise, it needs exactly the same amount of memory as that of array. Given some array A, first we build data structure in some other array T. Ti stores the sum of the elements Astart, Astart + 1, ., Ai. Index start is calculated with formula start = Fdown(i) = (i & (i + 1)). Here ""&"" denotes bitwise AND operation.

Rearranging Cartons ,"Your school has ordered some equipment that has been delivered in a number of very heavy cartons. Each carton has a serial number S and the cartons are all lined up in a row. Unfortunately, your teacher asked for the cartons to be placed in a particular sequence and you forgot to tell the people who unloaded the cartons about this. You now have to quickly restore the cartons to the correct order before the teacher comes and sees how you have messed up her instructions. Since the cartons are very heavy, you cannot carry them over long distances. In each step, all you can do is to exchange the position of two adjacent cartons. For instance, suppose the serial numbers on the cartons in the order in which they are unloaded are 34,29,12,78,9034,29,12,78,9034, 29, 12, 78, 90 and the order in which the cartons were supposed to be arranged is 90,29,78,34,1290,29,78,34,1290, 29, 78, 34, 12. These cartons can be rearranged in the desired order with 7 exchanges, as follows: Exchange 78,9078,9078, 90 — 34,29,12,90,7834,29,12,90,7834, 29, 12, 90, 78 Exchange 12,9012,9012, 90 — 34,29,90,12,7834,29,90,12,7834, 29, 90, 12, 78 Exchange 34,2934,2934, 29 — 29,34,90,12,7829,34,90,12,7829, 34, 90, 12, 78 Exchange 12,7812,7812, 78 — 29,34,90,78,1229,34,90,78,1229, 34, 90, 78, 12 Exchange 34,9034,9034, 90 — 29,90,34,78,1229,90,34,78,1229, 90, 34, 78, 12 Exchange 29,9029,9029, 90 — 90,29,34,78,1290,29,34,78,1290, 29, 34, 78, 12 Exchange 34,7834,7834, 78 — 90,29,78,34,1290,29,78,34,1290, 29, 78, 34, 12 In this example, it can be shown that 7 exchanges are needed to reorder the cartons as desired. Clearly, you want to get the job done with minimum eﬀort. Given the initial arrangement of the cartons and the ﬁnal sequence that the teacher wants, your goal is to compute the minimum number of exchanges required to rearrange the cartons in the desired order.

Chef and Queries ,"As part of his daily job, Chef has to solve problems involving sets. Till now, Chef has been using inefficient methods to solve his set related problem, wasting a lot of his precious time. He has agreed to pay you a lot of money for solving the following problem for him efficiently. First, Chef needs to perform Q operations on a set. Each operation is either: 1. Add a number to the set (if this number is NOT already present in the set). 2. Erase a number from the set (if this number exists in the set). Then, he needs to find the sum of all elements of the set after performing these Q queries. Your job is to find this sum for him quickly.

Nasty Queries ,"Hussain was doing research on graph theory, and he came up with a new family of graphs called Deadwing Graphs. Consider an undirected graph. We can partition the vertices uniquely into connected components, such that two vertices belong to the same connected component if and only if they are connected by a sequence of edges. We call a graph Good, if for every vertex, there is a walk starting from that vertex, and ending at the vertex, while using every edge exactly once. In other words, for every vertex, you should be able to start from that vertex, and following the edges, end at the same vertex, and have traversed every edge exactly once. A Deadwing Graph is an undirected graph, such that if the graph is decomposed into its connected components, then each connected component is Good. Hussain has an undirected graph with N nodes, and a list of M edges: E1, E2, .., EM. The nodes are numbered from 1 to N. He wants you to answer Q queries. Each query is denoted by 2 integers l, r: Consider all the edges between the l-th and the r-th edge. You must tell if the graph formed by these edges forms a Deadwing graph or not. That is, consider a new graph, which has the same set of vertices as the original graph, but the edges are only El, El+1, .., Er. You need to check whether this graph is a Deadwing Graph or not.

Multiuser Environments ,"Linux is designing a new OS to operate in a multiuser environment. All the users would be connected to a central machine. This central machine can allocate or de-allocate resources to the connected users in order to maximize overall performance. The OS has a limitation. If a particular program is running on more than 2 computers the central machine terminates this program on all the machines running it. To do this, the central machine assigns a unique identification number Z to each of the programs. The central machine runs a periodic check in which it obtains a list from each of users stating identification number of all the programs running on their systems. If the central machine finds that a particular program is running on more than 2 machines it terminates it on all machines. This task of periodic checks and obtaining the lists has been implemented in the OS. In order to terminate the programs, the OS need to know in advance the exact number of programs it is going to terminate. So given these lists, can you design a program which can tell the OS the number of programs it is going to terminate. Note: You need to specify only the number of ‘programs’ it is going to terminate and not the number of machines on which that program is running. For eg. If a program is running on 4 computers, for the OS this counts as a single program which it needs to terminate..

Before they play these games, Alice should choose a positive integer G between 1 and M (inclusive). The rules of each game are as follows: There is a set S of positive integers representing allowed moves in this game. For each valid i, in the i-th game, this set is S={ALi,ALi+1,…,ARi}S={ALi,ALi+1,…,ARi}S = {A_{L_i},A_{L_i+1},ldots,A_{R_i}} (in other words, given by a contiguous subsequence of A).

Maximum Difference Walk ,"Chef has a complete directed graph composed of N vertices. The graph contains a directed edge from every vertex i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) to every other vertex j (j != i) .We will denote such an edge by (i, j) and we will say that i is its starting vertex and j is its destination vertex. Thus, there are N(N-1) directed edges overall. Each of the directed edges has a unique cost in the range 1, 2, . N(N-1). Chef wants to play a game on this graph and has chosen you as his opponent. The game consists of alternating moves and you make the first move. Your first move consists of choosing a directed edge from the graph. Let's assume that this edge is (v1, v2). Then Chef will choose an edge (v2, v3). After that, at his/her turn, each player (whether you or Chef) will choose a directed edge which has not been chosen before by any of the players and whose starting vertex is the destination vertex of the directed edge chosen in the previous move (by the opponent). Thus, at your second move, you will choose an edge (v3, v4), then Chef will choose an edge (v4, v5), and so on. The game will end when the player whose turn is next cannot make any move (meaning that the destination vertex of the last chosen edge has no unselected outgoing edges left). Note that depending on how the game is played, the final move may be made by either Chef or you. Also note that the sequence of selected edges denotes a walk in Chef's graph, which may visit the same vertex zero or more times, but cannot visit the same directed edge more than once. At the end of the game your game score GSyou and Chef's game score GSChef will be computed. GSyou is defined as the sum of the costs of all the edges you selected during the game and GSChef is analogously defined as the sum of the costs of all the edges Chef selected during the game. Your final score FS for the game is defined as the difference GSyou - GSChef (note that FS could be zero or negative as well). Chef implemented his strategy in the interactive judge for this problem. However, this problem seems very complex to Chef, so he could only implement one of the two basic strategies described below: Strategy MAX: Let's assume that the last edge you selected is (a, b) and it is now Chef's turn to move. Chef will select the non-selected edge (b, c) having maximum cost among all the possible edges he can select (if any). Strategy RANDOM: Let's assume that the last edge you selected is (a, b) and it is now Chef's turn to move. Among all the non-selected edges (b, c), Chef will select one uniformly at random. Your task is to write a program which plays the game against Chef (i.e. against the interactive judge). Your program will have perfect information about the graph before making the first move, but will not know Chef's strategy before-hand. Once you start playing, though, you may be able to guess Chef's strategy from the moves he makes. Tags: challenge, game-theory, july15, mugurelionut ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/MAXDIFFW,CC

Random Game ,"This is an interactive problem. Rick and Morty were on an adventure when they somehow broke their portal gun. While they had to wait for help from another dimension, they decided to play a random game with the following rules: Initially, they are given a number N by Birdman. The players (Rick and Morty) alternate turns, starting with Rick. In each turn, if N is even, the current player must divide N by 2. Otherwise, the current player must either increase or decrease N by 1. If N becomes 0 afterwards, the current player (the player who made N equal to 0) wins the game. You are playing the game for Rick. First, you must decide if it is possible to win the game for a given starting value of N if both players play optimally. If it is possible, you must also play and win the game. Interaction First, you should read a line containing a single integer ― the number of test cases T. The description of interaction for T test cases follows. For each test case, first, you should read a line containing a single integer ― the initial value of N. Then, you should print a line containing the string ""Win"" if you can win the game or ""Lose"" if you cannot win. If you printed ""Lose"", you should read a line containing a single string. If this string is ""WA"", you could have actually won, so you should terminate your program immediately. Otherwise, this string is ""GG"" and you should continue solving the remaining test cases. If you printed ""Win"", you should continue by playing the game. When it is your turn: You should print a line containing a single string describing your move — ""/2"" if N is even or one of the strings ""+1"" or ""-1"" if N is odd. Then, you should read a line containing a single string. If N became 0 and you won the game, this string is ""GG"" and you should continue solving the remaining test cases. If the move you made was invalid (for example, you printed an invalid line), this string is ""WA"" and you should terminate your program immediately. Otherwise, this string is ""+1"", ""-1"" or ""/2"" and describes Morty's move in the following turn. If N becomes 0 after this move, you lost the game and you should also terminate your program immediately. Whenever you lose a game, make an invalid move or incorrectly decide that you could not have won some game, your submission is incorrect.

A-B Game ,"Two players (let's call them A and B) are playing a game on a row of cells. A cell may contain the character 'A', contain the character 'B' or be empty. Each character may only be moved from a cell cicic_i to a cell cfcfc_f if cell cfcfc_f and all cells between cicic_i and cfcfc_f are currently empty. The leftmost (first) character may only be moved to the right, the second character may only be moved to the left, the next character to the right, and so on. Each character may be moved any number of times, including zero. The players alternate turns; player A starts. On each turn, the current player must choose a cell containing their own character ('A' for player A, 'B' for player B) and move it to a different cell. This cell may be chosen arbitrarily as long as all rules described above are satisfied. The first player that cannot move a character loses. Note that each character is always moved in a fixed direction, so the game is finite. Determine the winner of the game if both players play optimally.

Subtraction Game ,"Two players are playing a game. The game is played on a sequence of positive integer pairs. The players make their moves alternatively. During his move the player chooses a pair and decreases the larger integer in the pair by a positive multiple of the smaller integer in the pair in such a way that both integers in the pair remain positive. If two numbers in some pair become equal then the pair is removed from the sequence. The player who can not make any move loses (or in another words the player who encounters an empty sequence loses). Given the sequence of positive integer pairs determine whether the first player can win or not (assuming that both players are playing optimally).

Easy Math ,"Chef is attending math classes. On each day, the teacher gives him homework. Yesterday, the teacher gave Chef a sequence of positive integers and asked him to find the maximum product of two different elements of this sequence. This homework was easy for Chef, since he knew that he should select the biggest two numbers. However, today, the homework is a little bit different. Again, Chef has a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,ANA_1, A_2, ldots, A_N, but he should find two different elements of this sequence such that the sum of digits (in base 101010) of their product is maximum possible.

Simultaneous Nim ,"Chef is a famous Nim player. He has his own set of N heaps, and the i-th heap contains Ai stones. What is so special about this set is that with this set of stones Chef always wins when he's moving second. Chef's friends don't know the math behind the game at all, but the fact that Chef is playing with the same set of stones all the time seems suspicious to them. To prove that he's a really good player even with other sets, Chef decided to split his set into K sets so that each of the N original heaps is used in exactly one set. Then he's going to play K Nim games simultaneously with these sets. Chef's ultimate goal is letting his opponent move first in each of these K games and still winning all the games! To make it even more impressive, Chef wants the value of K to be as large as possible. It's of no secret that in the game of Nim a position is winning for the player moving second if XOR of all the numbers of stones in the heaps is equal to 0; for more information check this. You may assume that Chef and his opponents always play optimally -- they always win whenever they have a winning strategy. You are to help Chef with this separation. Note that this is a challenge problem: it's not required for K to be maximum possible, but the bigger is K, the more points you get.

Chef is one of the developers of this website and today he thought that it's good idea to add new feature to it, the feature is that whenever a player creates a new game before asking the player to wait for an opponent the website will try to automatically find suitable opponent among those who already have created a game and still waiting for opponent, the website should choose the opponent such that all parameters specified by both players must be satisfied, if more than one suitable match exists then the player who just created a game will be matched with the suitable player who created a game first, if there's no match at all then the website will ask the player to wait for an opponent. rules applied to check whether two players can be matched: rating of each player is inside the range of rating that the other player selected both players selected the game to be rated, or both of them selected the game to be unrated total thinking time chosen by both players are equal both players chose random color, or one of them chose white while the other chose black Now, given a list of players who created a new game, in the same order of creating, for each player find out if this player should be matched with another player who is at that time waiting for an opponent , if there are more than one possible match, then choose the one who created a game first (thus has waited more), if there is no match then ask the player to wait. note that once a player is matched with another one then both players can no longer be matched with other players. also in this problem no player will join a game manually, all of them will create new game.

Cards Game ,"Let us play a game of cards. As you all know there are 52 cards in a regular deck, but our deck is somewhat different. Our deck consists of N cards. Each card simply contains a unique number from 1 to N. Initially all the cards are kept on the table, facing up. Rob, the notorious kid, flipped some of the cards, i.e. made them face down. Now, your task is to print any valid sequence of magic operations (as defined below) such that after a maximum of K magic operations, all the cards are facing upwards only. A magic operation on card at position i consists of flipping its direction from up to down and vice versa. Also, if there exists a card on its right side, i.e. at position (i+1), that is also flipped. Print the index of the cards that you are going to perform the magic operation on.

Stingy Strings ,"Problem Statement It is 2042 and we are surrounded by cyborgs everywhere. Geneo is one such cyborg with a human body and an electronic brain. To monitor skills and health of Geneo he is posed with questions everyday. On one fine day Geneo was asked the following question. You are given a string S of size N containing letters a to z. You are allowed to remove a character from the string and exchange it for a number signifying its position. i.e a -> 1, b -> 2, c -> 3, . z -> 26. After some number of these operations you arrive at a final array A. Power P of any such array is defined as: count of letters - count of numbers + (sum of numbers/K) where K is a given integer and '/' denotes float division. Geneo has to find maximum possible power Pmax of such an array.You want to test if Geneo is right. For this you have to generate correct answers for the question.

Worst Case Analysis ,"All of you must have heard of merge sort while learning sorting algorithms. So, now is time to explore it more. Let us consider the following merge function in the merge sort algorithm: (Assume 1-base indexing) void merge(int a[], int b[], int n1, int n2, int c[]) /* Function to merge the 2 arrays a[1..n1] and b[1..n2] into array c[1..n1+n2] */ { int i = 1, j = 1, k = 1; while (i <= n1 && j <= n2) { if (a[i] <= b[j]) { /* This is considered as 1 comparison */ c[k] = a[i]; i++; } else { c[k] = b[j]; j++; } k++; } while (i <= n1) { c[k] = a[i]; i++; k++; } while (j <= n2) { c[k] = b[j]; j++; k++; } } Now, in the function above, let us denote the maximum number of comparisons needed in the worst case while merging 2 arrays of sizes n1 and n2 as X. We are given M sorted arrays of size n1, n2, n3, ., nM. To make a larger array of size n1 + n2 + n3 + . + nM, you perform the following operation: If only 1 array is left then stop. Else Pick any 2 sorted arrays and merge them using the above operation. Assume, that while merging any 2 arrays, it always takes worst case in the number of comparisons. You are required to minimise the number of comparison operations. Tags: easy, icl2017, likecs, priority-queue ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/ICL1704,CC
Maze Love ,"Problem Statement Olivia, another cyborg with crafted legs is a very dear friend of Geneo. On the eve of valentines day, Olivia decides to surprise Geneo by arriving at his home with a gift. The gift is special, so is her way of reaching home. Olivia's legs are driven by batteries and can deliver only a fixed amount of energy. Once she has charged the batteries for certain period, she knows exactly how much energy they contain. Let this energy be P. She wants to completely consume the energy in travelling so that she gets to stay at Geneo's home longer under the guise of charging the batteries. As it is 2042, the roads in town form a perfect rectangular maze. Olivia lives at the corner (0,0) and Geneo lives at position (XGeneo, YGeneo). Each direction (North, South, East and West) has its associated per unit travel costs given by CNorth, CSouth, CEast and CWest. Her aim is that the energy left after reaching Geneo's home should be exactly zero. Note 1: You can assume the town to be laid out infinitely in all the directions. Note 2: The following are the meaning of directions: North : From (x, y) to (x, y + 1) South : From (x, y) to (x, y - 1) East : From (x, y) to (x + 1, y) West : From (x, y) to (x - 1, y) Tags: easy-medium, greatest-common-divisor, icl2018, likecs, likecs ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/ICL1804,CC

Interactive Matrix ,"Chef and his wife Chefina started playing a new game. At the beginning of the game, Chefina secretly writes down a matrix A with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and N columns (numbered 1 through N). All elements of this matrix are distinct positive integers. Then, Chefina asks Chef to find the position (row and column) of the element with value V, or determine that such an element does not occur in A. Chef does not know the matrix A, but he can ask Chefina at most K questions about it. Each question must be in the format 1rc1rc1, r, c; Chefina answers Chef with the number Ar,cAr,cA_{r, c}. Since this task is really hard for Chef, Chefina decided to give him additional help — she told Chef that the matrix she writes down has a special property: each row and each column is sorted in some order (descending or ascending). Different rows and columns may be sorted in different order. Chef may ask at most K questions in the format above. Afterwards, he must tell Chefina the position of the element V in the format 2ij2ij2, i, j, with the meaning that Ai,j=VAi,j=VA_{i, j} = V if V occurs in A, or with i=j=−1i=j=−1i=j=-1 if V does not occur in A. This is an interactive problem. You should play the game for Chef; the grader plays for Chefina.

Warehouseman (Challenge) ,"In order to save money, Chef has started buying bulk shipments of shelf-stable foods when they're on sale, then storing them in a warehouse until needed. This saves a lot of money, but Chef is having trouble managing the warehouse and needs your help getting shipments in and out of it. Chef's warehouse is a grid with R rows and C columns. There is a single entrance to the warehouse in the northwest corner. Rows run from west to east and columns run from north to south, so e.g. north is the direction of decreasing row number. A single forklift is used to move shipments around the warehouse. The forklift occupies one cell in the warehouse (initially, the northwest corner cell), and each shipment also occupies one cell in the warehouse. The forklift can carry up to one shipment at a time, and while carrying a shipment, the forklift and that shipment occupy the same cell. The forklift can move in any of the four cardinal directions, but it must stay in the warehouse and cannot occupy the same cell as a shipment it does not currently carry. When the forklift is not carrying a shipment, it can pick up a newly arrived shipment from the entrance (such a shipment does not occupy any cell until it is picked up), or it can load a shipment from an adjacent cell. When the forklift is carrying a shipment, it can drop it off at the entrance (a shipment does not occupy any cell after being dropped off) or unload it to an adjacent empty cell. There are R⋅C−1R⋅C−1Rcdot C - 1 shipments numbered 1 through R⋅C−1R⋅C−1Rcdot C - 1. The shipments will arrive in some order given on the input, and they must be picked up in this order and placed into the warehouse one at a time. Then, the shipments must be retrieved from the warehouse and dropped off at the entrance, in the order from 1 to R⋅C−1R⋅C−1Rcdot C - 1. You must produce a sequence of instructions for the forklift operator. The shorter the sequence of instructions you produce, the better. The types of forklift instructions are as follows: 'N', 'W', 'S', 'E': Move one cell north, west, south, or east, respectively. The destination cell must be inside the warehouse and must not contain any shipment. 'P': Pick up a shipment. The forklift must be at the warehouse entrance and it must not be currently carrying a shipment. After performing this instruction, the forklift will be currently carrying the shipment it picked up — the next element from the sequence of incoming shipments. This instruction cannot be performed after all arriving shipments have been picked up. 'D': Drop off a shipment. The forklift must be at the warehouse entrance and it must be carrying a shipment. This instruction cannot be performed before all incoming shipments have been picked up or after all shipments have been dropped off. A dropped off shipment cannot be picked up. ""Lx"": Load a shipment from a side-adjacent cell. The character x must be one of 'N', 'W', 'S', 'E', and it indicates the direction of the cell to load the shipment from. For example, to load a shipment from the cell to the north of the forklift, use 'LN'. The forklift must not be currently carrying a shipment and there must be a shipment at the specified cell. The forklift remains in its current cell after this instruction, but is now carrying the shipment it loaded. ""Ux"": Unload a shipment to a side-adjacent cell. The character x must again be one of 'N', 'W', 'S', 'E', and it indicates the direction of the cell to unload the shipment to. For example, to unload a shipment to the cell to the north of the forklift, use 'UN'. The forklift must be currently carrying a shipment and there must not be a shipment at the specified cell. The forklift remains in its current cell after this instruction, but the unloaded shipment is now in the specified cell.

Chef and Robots Competition ,"In Chefland, there is a monthly robots competition. In the competition, a grid table of N rows and M columns will be used to place robots. A cell at row i and column j in the table is called cell (i, j). To join this competition, each player will bring two robots to compete and each robot will be placed at a cell in the grid table. Both robots will move at the same time from one cell to another until they meet at the same cell in the table. Of course they can not move outside the table. Each robot has a movable range. If a robot has movable range K, then in a single move, it can move from cell (x, y) to cell (i, j) provided (|i-x| + |j-y| <= K). However, there are some cells in the table that the robots can not stand at, and because of that, they can not move to these cells. The two robots with the minimum number of moves to be at the same cell will win the competition. Chef plans to join the competition and has two robots with the movable range K1 and K2, respectively. Chef does not know which cells in the table will be used to placed his 2 robots, but he knows that there are 2 cells (1, 1) and (1, M) that robots always can stand at. Therefore, he assumes that the first robot is at cell (1, 1) and the other is at cell (1, M). Chef wants you to help him to find the minimum number of moves that his two robots needed to be at the same cell and promises to give you a gift if he wins the competition.

Ancient Berland Roads ,"In Ancient Berland, there were N towns, along with M bidirectional roads connecting them. With time, some roads became unusable, and nobody repaired them. As a person who is fond of Ancient Berland history, you now want to undertake a small research study. For this purpose, you want to write a program capable of processing the following kinds of queries: D K : meaning that the road numbered K in the input became unusable. The road numbers are 1-indexed. P A x : meaning that the population of the Ath town became x. Let's call a subset of towns a region if it is possible to get from each town in the subset to every other town in the subset by the usable (those, which haven't already been destroyed) roads, possibly, via some intermediary cities of this subset. The population of the region is, then, the sum of populations of all the towns in the region. You are given the initial road system, the initial population in each town and Q queries, each being one of two types above. Your task is to maintain the size of the most populated region after each query. Tags: Disjoint Set Union Advanced Data Structures ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/ABROADS,CC

Today, Chef Go is going to make a new menu with two dishes: Tom Yum Goong and Tom Kha Kai. He needs to pick as many flowers as possible to decorate the dishes and make them look attractive. Each dish can only be decorated with flowers of a single type, so he can only pick flowers of one type or two different types. Also, Chef Go wants the flowers he picks to form one connected area, so that he can finish his job quickly. A connected area is a set of cells such that we can move from any cell to any other cell in this set by only moving between side-adjacent cells from the set.

Chef and Linear Chess ,"Chef wants to play a game of linear chess on a one-dimensional board ― an infinite row of squares numbered by positive integers. In this game, he has a pawn, which is initially at a square K. There are also N other people (numbered 1 through N); Chef can choose one of them to play against. For each valid i, the i-th player would play in the following way: Take a pawn and place it on a square PiPiP_i. Repeat the following move any number of times: move the pawn from its current square PiPiP_i squares forward, i.e. from a square s, this player's pawn is moved to the square s+Pis+Pis+P_i. If this player moves their pawn to the square with Chef's pawn, then Chef's pawn is captured and he loses the game. Unfortunately, Chef cannot move his pawn during the game, making him an easy target for other players. Given the starting positions of all N+1N+1N+1 players, find a player who can capture Chef's pawn in the smallest number of moves or determine that no player can capture his pawn.

Chef and cakes ,"Chef has bought N robots to transport cakes for a large community wedding. He has assigned unique indices, from 1 to N, to each of them. How it will happen? Chef arranges the N robots in a row, in the (increasing) order of their indices. Then, he chooses the first M robots and moves them to the end of the queue. Now, Chef goes to the robot at the first position in the row and hands it one cake. He then notes this robot's index (say k) in his notebook, and goes to the kth position in the row. If the robot at this position does not have a cake, he give him one cake, notes his index in his notebook, and continues the same process. If a robot visited by Chef already has a cake with it, then he stops moving and the cake assignment process is stopped. Chef will be satisfied if all robots have a cake in the end.

Lucas Theorem ,"Chef is tired of solving boring math problems by hand. One of these problems is summing up the products of elements from each k-subset of the set [n]. Here, a k-subset is a subset containing exactly k elements and [n] refers to the set which contains all integers between 1 and n (inclusive). More formally: Let’s denote this number by f(n, k). Note that f(n, 0) = 1. Since calculating f(n, k) is too boring, Chef wants to know how the divisibility of f(n, k) by a given prime p depends on k. Specifically, for a fixed n, you should compute the number of ways to select k (0 ≤ k ≤ n) so that f(n, k) isn't divisible by p. After a while of thinking, Chef realized there might be too many ways to do that. Therefore, you should compute this number modulo 109+7.

Chef and Rainbow Road ,"Chef was relaxing outdoors after a poor performance during his university varsity's yearly week-long training retreat in the mountains. He was looking for a sign that he should continue competitive programming, even though at times, it can feel insurmountably difficult. Then, he looked up and saw a dazzling rainbow in the sky. He was so moved by the beauty of nature that he decided to continue programming and even created this problem about a mathematical Rainbow Road. Let the Rainbow Road be a grid with M rows (numbered 1 through M from top to bottom) and N columns (numbered 1 through N from left to right). Let's denote a cell in row i and column j by (i,j)(i,j)(i,j), i.e. (1,1)(1,1)(1,1) is the cell in the top left corner and (M,N)(M,N)(M,N) is the cell in the bottom right corner. Chef selected N distinct positive integers a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aNa_1, a_2, ldots, a_N and instead of using colours, he ""painted"" stripes on the road with these numbers. For each valid j, each cell in column j has the same value ajaja_j. You should answer Q queries. In each query: You are given an integer K. Chef wants to travel from the cell (1,1)(1,1)(1,1) to the cell (K,N)(K,N)(K,N). It is only possible to travel from any cell to the cell directly below it or to the cell directly to the right (if they exist). Formally, if Chef is in a cell (i,j)(i,j)(i,j), he may only travel to (i+1,j)(i+1,j)(i+1,j) or (i,j+1)(i,j+1)(i,j+1). Let's define a path as a sequence of cells c1,c2,…,csc1,c2,…,csc_1, c_2, ldots, c_s such that for each i (1≤i<s1≤i<s1 le i lt s), Chef can travel from the cell cicic_i to the cell ci+1ci+1c_{i+1}. The weight of a path is the product of the values of all cells in that path. Chef wants you to find the sum of the weights of all possible paths that start in the cell (1,1)(1,1)(1,1) and end in the cell (K,N)(K,N)(K,N).

Expected Number of Customers ,"A cake consists of N pieces arranged in a row. Each piece has one of M distinct flavours (numbered 1 through M) which are available in Chef's kitchen. For each valid i, the cost of the i-th flavour is i rupees. When Chef bakes a cake, he chooses the flavour of each piece independently and uniformly randomly from these M flavours. After baking the cake, he splits it into several contiguous segments (each piece must belong to exactly one segment) and sells each segment to a different customer. The price of a segment is the sum of costs of all distinct flavours of the pieces in that segment. For example, the cost of a segment with flavours (1,2,1,5)(1,2,1,5)(1, 2, 1, 5) is 1+2+5=81+2+5=81+2+5=8. Chef's profit is the sum of prices of all segments. Chef is very greedy, so he wants to maximise his profit, but he is also a perfectionist, so he wants to split the cake into the minimum number of segments such that his profit is still the largest possible. Chef is wondering about the number of customers he would be able to serve. Help him find the expected value of the number of segments he would split a cake into. It can be proved that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction p/qp/qp/q, where p and q are positive integers and q is coprime to 109+7109+710^9+7. You should find p⋅q−1p⋅q−1p cdot q^{-1} modulo 109+7109+710^9+7, where q−1q−1q^{-1} denotes the multiplicative inverse of q modulo 109+7109+710^9+7.

Chef and Ingredients ,"Chef wants to make a feast. In order to do that, he needs a lot of different ingredients. Each ingredient has a certain tastiness; the tastiness of each ingredient may be any positive integer. Initially, for each tastiness between K and K+N−1K+N−1K+N-1 (inclusive), Chef has an infinite supply of ingredients with this tastiness. The ingredients have a special property: any two of them can be mixed to create a new ingredient. If the original ingredients had tastiness x and y (possibly x=yx=yx = y), the new ingredient has tastiness x+yx+yx+y. The ingredients created this way may be used to mix other ingredients as well. Chef is free to mix ingredients in any way he chooses any number of times. Let's call a tastiness v (v>0v>0v gt 0) unreachable if there is no way to obtain an ingredient with tastiness v; otherwise, tastiness v is reachable. Chef wants to make ingredients with all reachable values of tastiness and he would like to know the number of unreachable values. Help him solve this problem.

The second hero visits cells in column-major order: (1,1)→(2,1)→…→(N,1)→(1,2)→(2,2)→…→(N,2)→…→(N,M)(1,1)→(2,1)→…→(N,1)→(1,2)→(2,2)→…→(N,2)→…→(N,M)(1,1) rightarrow (2,1) rightarrow ldots rightarrow (N,1) rightarrow (1,2) rightarrow (2,2) rightarrow ldots rightarrow (N,2) rightarrow ldots rightarrow (N,M). We know that each hero destroys the first cell he visits, rests in the next K cells he visits without destroying them, then destroys the next cell he visits, rests in the next K cells, destroys the next cell, and so on until he reaches (and rests in or destroys) the last cell he visits. Anas does not know the value of K. Therefore, for each value of K between 0 and N⋅M−1N⋅M−1N cdot M - 1 inclusive, he wants to calculate the number of cells that will be destroyed by at least one hero. Can you help him?

Even-tual Reduction ,"You are given a string S with length N. You may perform the following operation any number of times: choose a non-empty substring of S (possibly the whole string S) such that each character occurs an even number of times in this substring and erase this substring from S. (The parts of S before and after the erased substring are concatenated and the next operation is performed on this shorter string.) For example, from the string ""acabbad"", we can erase the highlighted substring ""abba"", since each character occurs an even number of times in this substring. After this operation, the remaining string is ""acd"". Is it possible to erase the whole string using one or more operations? Note: A string B is a substring of a string A if B can be obtained from A by deleting several (possibly none or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly none or all) characters from the end.

The cake is made up of a non-negative number of layers. Chef considers the deliciousness of the cake to be equal to the number of layers in the cake. A layer is a simple polygon whose vertices are some of Chef's N points. It is not required for each of Chef's points to belong to a layer. Furthermore, the layers must satisfy the following conditions: For each layer, the candle must lie strictly inside it. Each of Chef's N points that lies strictly inside some layer must belong to some other layer or be the candle point. No two layers may touch or intersect. The layers must be chosen in such a way that the deliciousness of the cake is maximum possible. Now, Chef is wondering about how the deliciousness of the cake depends on where he places the candle. You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given a point p=(x,y)p=(x,y)p = (x, y) where Chef wants to place the candle and you have to find the deliciousness of the cake.

Little Elephant and Alcohol ,"The Little Elephant and his friends from the Zoo of Lviv were returning from the party.

There were N elephants ordered from the left to the right in a row and numbered from 0 to N-1. Let R[i] to be the result of breathalyzer test of i-th elephant. Considering current laws in the Zoo, elephants would be arrested if there exists K consecutive elephants among them for which at least M of these K elephants have the maximal test result among these K elephants. Using poor math notations we can alternatively define this as follows. The elephants would be arrested if there exists i from 0 to N-K, inclusive, such that for at least M different values of j from i to i+K-1, inclusive, we have R[j] = max{R[i], R[i+1], ., R[i+K-1]}. The Big Hippo is very old and the Little Elephant can change some of the results. In a single operation he can add 1 to the result of any elephant. But for each of the elephants he can apply this operation at most once.

Corrupted Seven-Segment Display ,"Consider a seven-segment display, which can be used to show a decimal digit (0 through 9). When a digit is shown on a working display, specific segments of the display turn on, as depicted in the following image (for digits 1 through 9): 0 is depicted as usual, with all the segments turned on, except the middle one. Some of the segments of this display (possibly all or none) are dead ― they never turn on. In order to find out which segments could be dead, we ran N tests with the display. For each i (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N1 le i le N), in the i-th test, we tried to show the digit xixix_i and out of the 7 segments of the display, yiyiy_i segments turned on. It is possible that the results of tests have been recorded incorrectly. Determine if the recorded results are valid, i.e. if there is a set of dead segments such that in each test, the recorded number of segments that turned on is correct. If it is valid, calculate the minimum possible number of dead segments and the maximum possible number of dead segments consistent with the results of the tests.

Equivalent Exchange of Triangles ,"""Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange. In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one, and only truth."" -- Alphonse Elric Now, here we have an equivalent exchange law for triangles which states that two right-angled isosceles triangles of the same color can be made into a square of the same color using Alchemy. You are given N right-angled isosceles colored triangles numbered from 1 to N. For each triangle, the two equal sides have a length of 1 unit. The Color of i-th triangle is given by CiCiC_i. To create a tower, we choose some consecutive (2×k)+12×k)+12 times k)+1 triangles for any k≥0k≥0k geq 0. We then pick some 2×k2×k2 times k of them (these need not be consecutive), and form k pairs of triangles such that both triangles in pair have the same color. Also, each of the 2×k2×k2 times k should be in exactly one pair. Then the two triangles in each pair are joined using Alchemy (following the law of equivalent exchange for triangles) to form squares and these k squares are placed one upon other. The one remaining triangle is placed as a roof to the tower. This results in a tower of the height of k. Find the maximum height of the tower that can be formed. In other words, you should select the largest consecutive segment of triangles, such that you can form a tower using every single one of those triangles. In particular, you leave out one triangle, which will form the roof, and the other triangles should all be paired up such that both triangles in a pair have the same colour.

Little Party ,"A little party never killed nobody. After listening to this song many times Leha has decided to get together with his friends and have some fun again. But things are not as simple as you might think. Leha has N friends and he already had M parties with them and for some reason all these events were not good. He guesses that sometimes guys can't get across with each other. All his friends respect him and they always have come independently of their mood. And here is the problem: there is always some subset of his friends at the party that guys from these subset become angry. Now Leha wants to analyze previous events and find some groups of his friends(maybe empty) with correspondent moods which usually lead to problems. He perfectly remembers their states during previous time. A friend could have come either with good mood(in this case we will denote it as an upper-case Latin letter) or with bad mood(in this case we will denote it as an lower-case Latin letter). The same letters(even if their cases differ) correspond to one friend and different letters correspond to different friends. Let's consider an example: Leha has 3 friends and he had 3 parties with them with states AbC(friends A and C were in good mood, but B was in bad mood), Abc(A was in good mood, others were in bad), aBC(A was in bad mood, others were in good). During all these parties something had gone wrong. We can notice that when there is subset Ab(A was in good mood, but B was in bad mood) party is spoiled and the mood of friend C doesn't matter. We also have party with state aBC which gives us problems. We can't say anything special about other subsets(for example: here all parties are spoiled with subsets A, b but we don't have enough information to assume that these subsets are always bad) So we have two subsets which if are presented guarantee us some problems: Ab and aBC. We will call them key subsets. Leha wants to find several key subsets with minimal total size that describe all problem parties. In the example enough key subsets with minimal total size are: Ab and aBC with total size of 5. He could also find subsets straightforwardly AbC, Abc, aBC but their total size would be 9, so he will choose the first option. The idea of finding problem key subsets with minimal total size is good, but Leha doesn't like time-consuming and boring tasks. He asks you to do this job for him.

He assigns A as X[i] and B as X[j]. He then concatenates both the strings to create a new string C ( = A + B ). He calls a string ""super string"" if that string contains all the 20 letters of English alphabet he has just learnt,atleast once. Given the strings of the list, can you tell him how many such unordered pairs (i,j) he can choose such that string C is a super string.

Falling Rocks ,"You are in a magically discrete 2D world: an H * W grid containing H rows and W columns of cells. There are rocks at various positions (x, y), none of which can be at (1, 1) at the beginning, but there may be rocks in any other cell of the grid. (1, 1) refers to the bottom-left cell, and (W, H) refers to the top-right cell. The most interesting fact in this magic 2D world is that the rocks are falling down without any acceleration! More specifically, a rock which is at (x, y) at time t will be at (x, y - 1) at time t+1 and it will disappear once y becomes 0. At time t = 0, you are at the bottom-left cell of the grid denoted as (1, 1). (Note that this means that there is no rock at the starting point (1, 1) at the beginning.) You need to move left or right or stay at the same position in order to avoid being hit by a rock. That is, if you are at (x, 1) at time t, you could be at any of the cells (x - 1, 1), (x, 1), or (x + 1, 1) at time t + 1, assuming that cell exists. Along with space, time is also discrete in this magic world. In other words, this world is quantum physics gone berserk! At every second, you make your move, and then the rocks fall 1 cell down. So you should make sure that when you move to a cell at time (t + 1), there is no rock in that cell at time t as well as (t + 1). We are interested in computing how many different layouts of rocks you can survive if you always play in the optimal way after the layout is made available to you.

The 11-st power of the sequence AA is A1=AA^1 = A. For each k>1k gt 1, the kk-th power of the sequence AA (denoted by AkA^k) is a sequence with length NN such that for each valid ii, the ii-th element of this sequence is (Ak)i=(Ak−1)li⊕(Ak−1)li+1⊕…⊕(Ak−1)ri−1⊕(Ak−1)ri.(A^k)_i = (A^{k-1})_{l_i} oplus (A^{k-1})_{l_i+1} oplus ldots oplus (A^{k-1})_{r_i-1} oplus (A^{k-1})_{r_i} ,.

Selinas the Chefs Falling on the Tree ,"You are given a tree with N nodes numbered 1 through N, rooted at node 1. There are many really good ingredients on this tree, so M chefs Selinas are going to pick them all up. For each i (1≤i≤M1≤i≤M1 le i le M), the i-th Selina will start falling from the root in the titit_i-th second. Obviously, Selinas can only move in two directions — from each node, a Selina can fall to one of its children or bounce to its parent. When bouncing, there is only one path to take, but when falling, the Selina will choose the node to fall down to uniformly randomly among all children of the current node. One move in either direction takes one second. Each Selina only changes her direction (from bouncing to falling or vice versa) when she cannot keep moving in the current direction without leaving the tree or hitting another Selina, that is, when one of the following happens: reaching a leaf when falling reaching the root when bouncing meeting another Selina that's moving in the opposite direction At the Q-th second, we would like to know the expected number of Selinas that have passed through each node so far. Formally, let's denote the expected number of Selinas in node i at the j-th second by Ei,jEi,jE_{i, j}; for each node i, you should find the sum of Ei,jEi,jE_{i, j} over all seconds j between 1 and Q (inclusive). Compute these numbers modulo 998244353998244353998244353.

Expected Buildings ,"Chef is standing in the centre of a circle. The perimeter of the circle is divided into h units (numbered 1 through h) and some of those units contain buildings. There are N buildings in total (numbered 1 through N); let's denote the position of building i, i.e. the number of the unit containing this building, by pipip_i. Note that a unit may contain more than one building. Chef has a vision range equal to x. This means he can look at an arbitrary contiguous range of x units at the same time. Chef likes to play with his girlfriend Cheftanya. Since he belongs to Wakanda, he decided to play a shooting game. In this game, he is going to look in some direction and shoot all the buildings he sees (without looking in any other direction). Cheftanya chooses the direction in which he looks; since she loves mathematics, she is going to choose this direction randomly using a special probability density function defined below. Before playing the game, though, she is interested in the expected number of buildings Chef will shoot. Chef is going to be busy shooting, so she asks for your help. Can you impress Cheftanya with your skills? This expected value can be written as a fraction P/QP/QP/Q, where P and Q are coprime. Since we are in the 21st century, nobody is interested in fractions. Therefore, you should compute P⋅Q−1P⋅Q−1Pcdot Q^{-1} modulo 163577857163577857163577857, where Q−1Q−1Q^{-1} denotes the modular inverse of Q modulo 163577857163577857163577857. (It is guaranteed that this inverse exists and is unique.) Consider a sequence of integers a1,a2,…,aha1,a2,…,aha_1, a_2, dots, a_h; let's denote s=∑hi=1ais=∑i=1hais=sum_{i=1}^h a_i. We guarantee that s is not divisible by respective modulo (163577857163577857163577857). For each i (1≤i≤h1≤i≤h1 le i le h), the probability that Cheftanya directs Chef to look at units i,i+1,…,i+x−1i,i+1,…,i+x−1i, i+1, dots, i+x-1 is ai/sai/sa_i / s; the units are cyclic, so we can consider ""unit i"" to be equivalent to ""unit i−hi−hi-h"". Since the sequence a can be very large, you are only given its first K elements. You are also given a sequence c1,c2,…,cKc1,c2,…,cKc_1, c_2, dots, c_K; the remainder of sequence a can be generated using the formula ai=∑j=1Kcj⋅ai−j∀i:K<i≤h.ai=∑j=1Kcj⋅ai−j∀i:K<i≤h.a_i = sum_{j=1}^K c_jcdot a_{i-j} quad forall,i:;K lt i le h,.

Solving the Practice Contest ,"As we all know that team LaZyProblemSetters with participants V, J and K is gearing up for ICPC 2015, and have decided to solve a problem set to practice for the prelims round. The day of that practice round has now arrived and they are very eager to get started. They have picked up an ordered set of N problems to solve. Now, since they are newbies in the field of programming, they have chosen problems which are not so tough. Hence, every problem that they have taken is solvable by all the three members. To make it feel like the regional contest, they have decided to use only a single computer system.Since they are newbies, instead of optimizing on time and resources they have come up with the following plan to decide on how they would attempt to solve the problems. They have divided their total time in N time slots. In the ith time slot, they will code up the ith problem. Since they are easy problems, it is known that each problem would be solved within the given time slot. In each time slot, the computer will be allotted to either V, J or K. They will not share the computer with anyone else in the time slot allocated to them. Now all that is left is to decide who will solve which problem on the computer. To make things easier, all of them have listed their requirements on how the distribution of the problems should be. K being a lover of the number k has decided that the total number of problems coded by him will be a multiple of k. J being a busy guy decided to never code problems in consecutive slots. In the gaps between his slots, he has some other work that he wants to finish. V being a relatively new coder, wants to code at least one problem from the whole set. Your task is to find out the number of ways in which they can distribute the problems amongst themselves.

Deletion Sort ,"You are given an array A of length N. Let F(L,R)F(L,R)F(L,R) be the array you get from A after removing all occurrences of AL,AL+1,…,ARAL,AL+1,…,ARA_L, A_{L+1}, dots , A_R. In other words, for each value in A between the indices L and R, you delete every occurrence of that value, including occurrences outside the range [L,R][L,R][L, R]. A pair (L,R)(L,R)(L,R) is called good if 1≤L≤R≤N1≤L≤R≤N1le Lle Rle N and F(L,R)F(L,R)F(L, R) is sorted in non-decreasing order. In the case that F(L,R)F(L,R)F(L, R) is the empty array, we say it is sorted. Count the number of good pairs. Example: Suppose A=[1,2,3,5,7,6,8,6,5,8]A=[1,2,3,5,7,6,8,6,5,8]A=[1,2,3,5,7,6,8,6,5,8]. Then F(4,6)F(4,6)F(4,6) is the array we get after deleting all occurrences of the numbers 5,7,65,7,65,7,6. Thus, F(4,6)=[1,2,3,8,8]F(4,6)=[1,2,3,8,8]F(4,6)=[1,2,3,8,8]. This array is sorted in non-decreasing order, so the pair (4,6)(4,6)(4, 6) is good.

Crash It ,"Roger recently built a circular race track with length K. After hosting a few races, he realised that people do not come there to see the race itself, they come to see racers crash into each other (what's wrong with our generation…). After this realisation, Roger decided to hold a different kind of ""races"": he hired N racers (numbered 1 through N) whose task is to crash into each other. At the beginning, for each valid i, the i-th racer is XiXiX_i metres away from the starting point of the track (measured in the clockwise direction) and driving in the direction DiDiD_i (clockwise or counterclockwise). All racers move with the constant speed 1 metre per second. The lengths of cars are negligible, but the track is only wide enough for one car, so whenever two cars have the same position along the track, they crash into each other and the direction of movement of each of these cars changes (from clockwise to counterclockwise and vice versa). The cars do not change the directions of their movement otherwise. Since crashes reduce the lifetime of the racing cars, Roger sometimes wonders how many crashes happen. You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given an integer T and you should find the number of crashes that happen until T seconds have passed (inclusive).

Connecting Soldiers ,"To protect people from evil, a long and tall wall was constructed a few years ago. But just a wall is not safe, there should also be soldiers on it, always keeping vigil. The wall is very long and connects the left and the right towers. There are exactly N spots (numbered 1 to N) on the wall for soldiers. The Kth spot is K miles far from the left tower and (N+1-K) miles from the right tower. Given a permutation of spots P of {1, 2, ., N}, soldiers occupy the N spots in that order. The P[i]th spot is occupied before the P[i+1]th spot. When a soldier occupies a spot, he is connected to his nearest soldier already placed to his left. If there is no soldier to his left, he is connected to the left tower. The same is the case with right side. A connection between two spots requires a wire of length equal to the distance between the two. The realm has already purchased a wire of M miles long from Nokia, possibly the wire will be cut into smaller length wires. As we can observe, the total length of the used wire depends on the permutation of the spots P. Help the realm in minimizing the length of the unused wire. If there is not enough wire, output -1.

There are limits on the amount of queries of each type you can ask. Andrew and Kostya came up with the solution very quickly. But Sergey was really puzzled with this task. However, after thinking for some time, he came up with a solution too. And then he figured out that he actually misheard the original problem that was a really easy one. First Sergey got upset because of spending time for solving the non-existing problem, but then he realized that he can give this problem in a contest. So he proposes to solve his version of the problem. :) Tags: Interactive Problems, Recursion, Divide and Conquer Special, Algorithms ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/RESTPERM,CC
Dish Owner ,"This summer, there is a worldwide competition being held in Chef Town and some of the best chefs of the world are participating. The rules of this competition are quite simple. Each participant needs to bring his or her best dish. The judges will initially assign a score to each of the dishes. Now, several rounds will follow. In each round, any two chefs will be called up on the stage. Each of the chefs can then choose any one dish to battle against the other chef and the one having the dish with the higher score will win this round. The winner of the round will also obtain all the dishes of the loser who will then be eliminated. In case both the dishes have equal scores, this round will be considered as a tie and nothing else will happen. Note that initially each chef will have only one dish and all the chefs play the rounds optimally. Your task is to simulate and answer some queries related to this. You will be given N dishes numbered from 1 to N with the ith dish belonging to the ith chef initially. You will also be given an array S where S[i] denotes the score given by the judges to the ith dish before starting the rounds. You will have to answer Q queries, each of which can be of the following types : 1. 0 x y : This denotes that the chef containing dish number x competes with the chef containing dish number y currently in this round. If a single chef is the owner of both the dishes, print ""Invalid query!"" (without quotes), otherwise execute and store the result of this round as described by the rules above. 2. 1 x : You need to output the index of the chef containing dish x at this point.

Galactik Football ,"It's time! The Assosiation (GFA) has announced a football tournament between all the teams of all the planets in the galaxy. Each planet of the galaxy has a government. Some governments have a mutual agreement between them. If planet A has mutual agreement with planet B, then there is a bidirectional spaceway between A and B, using which anybody can go from A to B and vice-versa. People can use these spaceways to travel from one planet to another, if there exists a path between them using some of the spaceways. Each planet has its own football ground. The GFA has planned the matches in such a way that a team can have a match at any of these grounds. The GFA has come across some problems in the execution of their plan. They have found out that there are many pairs of planets between which there does not exist any path, so the football team of one of those planets can't reach the other planet. They requested the corresponding governments to make a spaceway between them, but they can’t because of the absence of a mutual agreement. So the GFA suggested that they will make teleportation devices between some pairs of planets which will be used only by the football teams to travel. But there are two types of governments in the galaxy Some of the governments are greedy and they want to make money through the GFA. Each of these government has asked the GFA for a tax value which it has to pay if it wants to make a teleport ending at their planet. Others want to sponsor the event, so they will give money to the GFA if they make a teleport ending at their planet. The GFA would always avoid such governments no matter what the consequences are, because these kind of governments always have some dirty plans up their sleeves. Now, the GFA wants to make bi-directional teleports between planets such that the football teams of any planet can reach any other planet to play a football match, using spaceways between the planets and/or teleports made by the GFA. The GFA also has financial problems and want to spend as little money as possible. They have come to you so that you can help them calculate the minimum amount of money needed to fulfil their plan.

Bitwise swaps ,"Given an array A consisting of N integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,ANA_1,A_2,…,A_N, determine if you can sort this array by applying the following operation several times (possibly, zero): Pick a pair of indices (i,j)(i,j)(i,j) with i≠ji≠ji neq j and Ai&Aj≠0Ai&Aj≠0A_i mathbin{&} A_j neq 0, and swap the values of AiAiA_i and AjAjA_j. Here, &&mathbin{&} denotes the bitwise AND operation. For example, if A=[6,4,2]A=[6,4,2]A = [6, 4, 2], the two possible operations are (1,2)(1,2)(1, 2) and (1,3)(1,3)(1, 3).

Jam Board ,"Jimmy is a very studious and obedient boy. He has recently joined Digital Circuits Course in his school. He is absolutely fascinated by digital circuits, and stays back in lab after school hours to make circuits. What interests him is plugging wires and voltage sources on and then lighting up an LED.A is a large plastic board, with lots of holes in it. The holes are arranged as following- Holes in a group of 5 share a common metallic plate, i.e if one of them gets a high voltage, then all 5 of them are at ""High"". The group is aligned vertically. There are several groups placed horizontally as well as vertically, depending on the dimensions of the Jam Board. For illustration, consider a Having 6 Columns and 2 Rows- A B C D E F A B C D E F A B C D E F A B 1 D E F A B C D 2 F G H I J K L G H I J K L G H I J K L G 3 I J K L G H I J K L All A's are in a group, and share same voltage. Notice the 3 above, it is basically in H group. How can we refer to the point 3 on Jam Board, using coordinate system? Candy for taking a guess! It is (2, 9), from Top Left. Now if Jimmy plugs one end of copper wire in 1 and the other in 2, then C and E will become a single group and start sharing voltage. Jimmy can apply a high voltage to any hole, and that group becomes ""high"". The is grounded, thus each group is initially at low voltage. When an LED is connected across two points, it glows up if there is a potential difference between the two points, i.e. when one end is ""high"" and the other is ""low"". The lab assistant must leave, but he allows Jimmy to stay with one Jam Board, one LED, one Voltage sources (with several output points) and lots of wires. So Jimmy gets down to work, he connects wires, applies (high) voltage, and occasionally connects the LED between two points. Sometimes he removes a voltage source as well. At times he connects a wire(or voltage source) to the point, which already has a wire(or voltage source) connected to it. This is not a good practice, but Jimmy is excused because he is new to electrical stuff. And when he removes voltage source from a point, he removes only one of it at a time. Since the number of connections is rather enormous and confusing, he requires your help to tell him whether the LED will light up each time he connects it. However Jimmy's cryptography classes have made him rather irksome. He is telling you the row or column not as a number, but in a Base-52 notation of his own. In this notation, each number is represented as 2 characters, where each character can be either A-Z or a-z.Here A = 0, B = 1, . Z = 25, a = 26, . z = 51. So 1 is represented as AB, 5 is AF, 97 is Bt. And to top that he doesn't give any gap between row number and column number, or between pair of coordinates (column and row), used to indicate the endpoints of wire.

Lovers Gift ,"Chef buys lots of gifts for his love Chefua. Chef keeps all his money in the bank, and so if he wants to buy a gift, he must go to one of the branches of the bank in the country to get money, and then buy the gift. The country where Chef lives consists of N cities which are connected by N - 1 bidirectional roads in such way that there is a unique path from any city to any other city. The cities numbered from 1 to N. It so happens that the city numbers directly determine the quality of a gift bought in that city. That is, the city numbered N would have the best gift, and so on. Initially, there are no branches of the bank in any city. Then one by one, the bank decides to open branches in some cities. If the Chef lives in city C and he wants to buy a gift, he would ideally want to buy from the city with the best gifts, which is City N. But remember that he has to take money from the bank. And Chef being lazy, does not want to travel extra just to go to the bank. He wants to go to the bank while going to the city from where he will buy the gift. In other words, he can buy from a City j, only if there is at least one bank branch in any of the cities on the unique path from City C to City j (both end points included). But he has realized that all people from his city go to the highest numbered city, and it gets very crowded. Hence, being smart, he has decided that among all the cities that he could buy gifts from (as described earlier), he will go to the city which has the second highest number. Note that he can buy the gift from the city where the bank branch exists. Chef also shifts his city frequently. These details and details of when and where the bank opens its branches are given to you. Each time Chef moves to a new city, you have to report which city he will buy the gift from.

Harry and Sirius Black were fighting dementors near the Great Lake. But since the number of dementors were way too large therefore he had to make the spell as powerful as possible. Now, he can change the spell S to S′S′S’ (making it stronger) by using m passes of the form (c1c1c_1,c2c2c_2). In each pass, he can change any character c1c1c_1 of the spell to c2c2c_2.

Tiptoe through the tulips ,"Cherry has discovered the Garden of Magical Tulips while going on a walk. The garden can be described as N nodes connected by N-1 trails. The nodes are numbered from 1 to N. Each trail i connects two different nodes, ui and vi and has length Li. It is possible to visit all the nodes starting from any node using a sequence of trails. Magical tulips like to grow alone, without being disturbed. So, every node has exactly one tulip growing there peacefully and a tulip never withers once it is fully grown. If a fully grown tulip is picked, a new one will grow in the same spot if it is left undisturbed for X contiguous days. Sometimes, when Cherry goes for a walk, she visits the garden to collect some tulips for her beloved Jimma, who is always waiting at the window to see Cherry pass by. The number of tulips she collects on a particular day depends on her mood. She gets bored while walking on long trails, so on day dj, Cherry will start at a node uj and visit all the nodes she can reach while taking only the trails whose length does not exceed kj. She will pick all the fully grown tulips she can find. But in the process, she might visit some nodes which do not have a fully grown tulip yet. These tulips will get upset and grow fully only after X days if Cherry doesn't disturb them again before that. i.e. if Cherry does not visit that node again before the day dj+X, then it will have a fully grown tulip on that day. On day d1, all the nodes have fully grown tulips. Cherry has never been to school and is not very good at counting, so she always wonders how many tulips she has collected. Please help Cherry figure out the number of tulips she collects for the next Q days she visits the garden.

One of the algorithms he is required to study is the Hungarian algorithm (you do not have to know this algorithm to solve this problem). In the Hungarian algorithm, you start with a matrix of positive integers with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and N columns (numbered 1 through N). The algorithm proceeds in steps. In the first step, for each row of the matrix, you should find the smallest element in this row (let's denote it by A) and subtract A from each element of the matrix in this row. In the second step, for each column of the matrix, you should find the smallest element in this column (let's denote it by A) and subtract A from each element in this column. The remaining steps of the algorithm are not relevant in this problem. Currently, Chef is practicing implementation of the first two steps of the algorithm.

Each ant is moving in a fixed direction: up, down, left or right. The anteaters do not move. The movement of ants happens in discrete steps. For example, when an ant is in the cell in the i-th row and j-th column at some point in time (in some step) and it is moving down, then in the next step, it enters the cell in the (i+1)(i+1)(i+1)-th row and j-th column. Two ants meet each other when they enter the same cell at the same point in time (in the same step). When ants meet, they do not interact in any way and keep moving in their fixed directions. If an ant reaches an anteater, that anteater eats the ant, so the ant completely disappears. If an ant attempts to leave the grid, it also disappears. When two ants enter a cell containing an anteater at the same time, they are eaten before they could meet. Calculate the total number of pairs of ants that meet each other.

Also, the widths and heights of the pieces must be integers, which implies that N must be a divisor of W and M must be a divisor of H. Let's denote a piece at column i and row j by (i,j)(i,j)(i,j). Next, Ada wants to reorder the pieces using the following operations (they may be performed in any order and any number of times): 1 r: Shift the row r of the matrix to the right, i.e. for each valid c, the final position of the piece (c,r)(c,r)(c,r) becomes (c+1,r)(c+1,r)(c+1,r) if c+1≤Nc+1≤Nc+1 le N or (1,r)(1,r)(1,r) otherwise. 2 c: Shift the column c of the matrix upwards, i.e. for each valid r, the final position of the piece (c,r)(c,r)(c,r) becomes (c,r+1)(c,r+1)(c,r+1) if r+1≤Mr+1≤Mr+1 le M or (c,1)(c,1)(c,1) otherwise. At the end, Ada does not sell the pieces separately, but as a single cake. Therefore, the final price of the cake is still twice the area of the smallest convex polygon that contains all raisins for this new cake. Help Ada slice the cake into at most 2102102^{10} pieces and perform at most 2102102^{10} operations to minimise the final price of the cake.

Queries on a Binary Tree ,"Let's consider a rooted binary tree with the following properties: The number of nodes and edges in the tree is infinite The tree root is labeled by 1 A node labeled by v has two children: 2⋅v2⋅v2 cdot v (the left child of v), and 2⋅v+12⋅v+12 cdot v + 1 (the right child of v). Here is an image of the first several layers of such a tree: Let's consider four operations that you are allowed to apply during the tree traversal: move to the left child - move from v to 2⋅v2⋅v2 cdot v move to the right child - move from v to 2⋅v+12⋅v+12 cdot v + 1 move to the parent as a left child - move from v to v2v2frac{v}{2} if v is an even integer move to the parent as a right child - move from v to v−12v−12frac{v - 1}{2} if v is an odd integer It can be proven, that for any pair of nodes u and v, there is only one sequence of commands that moves from u to v and visits each node of the tree at most once. Let's call such a sequence of commands a path configuration for a pair of nodes (u,v)(u,v)(u, v). You are asked to process a series of the following queries: You are given three integers n, u and v (1≤u,v≤n1≤u,v≤n1 leq u, v leq n).

Children Trips ,"There's a new trend among Bytelandian schools. The ""Byteland Touristic Bureau"" has developed a new project for the high-schoolers. The project is so-called ""Children's Trips"". The project itself is very simple: there are some touristic routes in Byteland, and N touristic campuses (numbered from 1 to N). For the sake of economy, there are exactly N-1 road between them. Of course, even having this given, it is possible to travel from any touristic campus to any other one. Moreover, for the sake of safety, each road is no longer than 2 kilometers. When some student wants to travel, he first chooses his starting campus - he is been delivered there (say) by a helicopter. He chooses his final destination campus as well. From his final destination, he will be transported to his home by (say) a helicopter, again. So that pupil won't travel any extra distance by foot. When the start and the finish are chosen and the pupil is delivered, he starts his moving by the only route. None of pupils is infinitely strong, so first the pupil looks at the map of the touristic routes, and then he chooses the furthest campus on his way that he can reach during the current day (by safety regulations, it is strictly prohibited to sleep not at the campus because there can be a little trouble with werewolves), and moves there. Then the new day begins, and it repeats till the moment when the destination is reached. Of course, not all the students created equal. Somebody is good in math, somebody in English, somebody in PE. So it's quite natural that all high-schoolers has different strengths. We call the strength is the maximal number of kilometers that the pupil can pass in a day. And now you're given a lot of queries from the children. For every query, you are given the starting campus, the final campus and the strength. You are requested to calculate the number of days for every trip. The map of the campuses and the distances between them will be given to you as well.

Festivals ,"The Chef is enjoying his vacation at the Tree city. As the name of it says, in this city, N locations, numbered from 1 to N, are connected by N − 1 bidirectional roads. Each road connects two cities and you can travel between any pair of cities through this roads system. Each road has the length, which is some positive integer. For any two locations the distance between them is the sum of the roads lengths for the path that connects them. Some festivals are regularly held in each location. Someday, several festivals (at least 2) take place at different locations. On that day people often participate in two festivals such that the distance between their locations is as large as possible. They move between these two locations to enjoy the festivals. Note that there may be more than one pair of locations satisfying this condition. The path connecting two such locations is called an ideal path. Knowing this, the Chef wants to find an optimal road where he will open temporary fast-food restaurant to earn as much money as possible from hungry festival participants that move by this road. In his honest opinion the best such road is the shortest road belonging to each ideal path. More formally he is asking you two questions as follows. Suppose in day X, there are K festivals that take place at K locations F1, F2, ., FK respectively. Find the distance between two furthest locations among the K locations listed above. Denote this value as A. Find the road with the minimal length belonging to each ideal path. That is, each path of length A, that connects Fi and Fj for some i and j, should contain this road. Denote the length of this road as B. If there is no such road than B is set to -1. Of course, Chef wants to know values A and B.

A node is called a center of a tree if it lies in the middle of at least one longest path in that tree.

Compression Algorithm ,"Mr. X has come up with a new string compression algorithm. Consider a string of length N which contains up to K distinct characters. The compression algorithm works as follows: Replace each maximal contiguous substring containing only one distinct character (repeated an arbitrary number of times) and replace it by 2 values: the character and the length of the substring. For example, the string ""aabba"" will be compressed to ""a, 2, b, 2, a, 3"". Thus the length of the compressed string is 6. Since Mr. X is living in advanced times, the length of any integer is considered to be 1. For example, if a string is compressed to ""a, 1, b, 13"", then its length after compression is considered to be 4. To test his algorithm, he needs to know the expected length of the compressed string for given N and K if the input string is randomly uniformly chosen from all possibilities.

Art ,"Chef's new hobby is painting, but he learned the fact that it's not easy to paint 2D pictures in a hard way, after wasting a lot of canvas paper, paint and of course time. From now on, he decided to paint 1D pictures only. Chef's canvas is N millimeters long and is initially all white. For simplicity, colors will be represented by an integer between 0 and 105. 0 indicates white. The picture he is envisioning is also N millimeters long and the ith millimeter consists purely of the color Ci. Unfortunately, his brush isn't fine enough to paint every millimeter one by one. The brush is 3 millimeters wide and so it can only paint three millimeters at a time with the same color. Painting over the same place completely replaces the color by the new one. Also, Chef has lots of bottles of paints of each color, so he will never run out of paint of any color. Chef also doesn't want to ruin the edges of the canvas, so he doesn't want to paint any part beyond the painting. This means, for example, Chef cannot paint just the first millimeter of the canvas, or just the last two millimeters, etc. Help Chef by telling him whether he can finish the painting or not with these restrictions.

Luv Kush and FX Sequence ,"Luv & Kush were very intelligent twin children of Lord Rama and Sita Mata. One day, Luv interestingly formed a sequence, named FXFXFX (FibXorFibXorFibXor) SequenceSequenceSequence. He was curious to find the nththth term of the sequence. So, instead of finding it himself and to test the intelligence of his brother, Kush, he asked Kush to find the nththth term. But, since Kush is busy learning ""Dhanur Vidhya"", so, you have to help him find the nththth term of the sequence. The ""FX Sequence"" was defined by two sequences: ""Modified Fibonacci Sequence (MFS)"" and ""Xorinacci Sequence (XS)"". Kush was given seven integers as input, n, a, b, c, d, e and f, where a and b were the starting terms of ""Modified Fibonacci Sequence"" and c and d were the starting terms of the ""Xorinacci Sequence"", and he had to find the nththth term of the FX Sequence. The sequences were defined as follows: MFS(0)MFS(0)MFS(0) = a MFS(1)MFS(1)MFS(1) = b MFS(x)MFS(x)MFS(x) = (e(e(e * MFS(x−1))MFS(x−1))MFS(x-1)) + (f(f(f * MFS(x−2))MFS(x−2))MFS(x-2)), where x>=2x>=2x>=2 XS(0)XS(0)XS(0) = c XS(1)XS(1)XS(1) = d XS(x)XS(x)XS(x) = XS(x−1)XS(x−1)XS(x-1) v XS(x−2)XS(x−2)XS(x-2), where x>=2x>=2x>=2 and ""v"" is the Bitwise-XOR Operator. Now, FX(x)FX(x)FX(x) = (MFS(x)(MFS(x)(MFS(x) * XS(x))XS(x))XS(x)) + (MFS(x)(MFS(x)(MFS(x) −−- XS(x))XS(x))XS(x)). So, now, you know the general formula for the xththth term of this special and interesting sequence. So, help Kush find the nththth term of the sequence. Since, the answer can be huge, output the nththth term (answer), modulo 998244353998244353998244353. Tags: algorithm, contest, externalcontest, vok_8 ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/FXSEQ,CC

Interaction First, you should read a line containing a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for T test cases follows. For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer N. To ask a question, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 1 and K, where 1≤K≤2⋅1061≤K≤2⋅1061 le K le 2 cdot 10^6. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer ― the answer to your question or −1−1-1 if the question is invalid or you asked more than 202020 questions.

This shelf is made in such a way that books can be inserted and removed only from the top. Books are placed one over the other in that shelf. Now to remember each book, Sudhanva develops an algorithm. He first writes a number in his iPad, then takes a photo of that number in his DSLR and then pastes that photograph on the cover of each book. Initially the bookshelf is empty. You have given Q queries of either of the two types • Type 1. (1,N)(1,N)(1, N) In this type of query Sudhanva places a book with photo of number N on the top. You don't have to print anything in this query • Type 2. (−1)(−1)(-1) In this Query Sudhanva takes out the topmost book, you have to print the number on the book he just took out.

Book Exercises ,"Harry is a bright student. To prepare thoroughly for exams, he completes all the exercises in his book! Now that the exams are approaching fast, he is doing book exercises day and night. He writes down and keeps updating the remaining number of exercises on the back cover of each book. Harry has a lot of books messed on the floor. Therefore, he wants to pile up the books that still have some remaining exercises into a single pile. He will grab the books one-by-one and add the books that still have remaining exercises to the top of the pile. Whenever he wants to do a book exercise, he will pick the book with the minimum number of remaining exercises from the pile. In order to pick the book, he has to remove all the books above it. Therefore, if there are more than one books with the minimum number of remaining exercises, he will take the one which requires the least number of books to remove. The removed books are returned to the messy floor. After he picks the book, he will do all the remaining exercises and trash the book. Since number of books is rather large, he needs your help to tell him the number of books he must remove, for picking the book with the minimum number of exercises. Note that more than one book can have the same name. Tags: Stacks Data Structures ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/BEX,CC
Doof fires Brackets ,"You may have tried your level best to help Chef but Dr Doof has managed to come up with his masterplan in the meantime. Sadly, you have to help Chef once again. Dr Doof has designed a parenthesis-inator. It throws a stream of N brackets at the target, 1 bracket per second. The brackets can either be opening or closing. Chef appears in front of the stream at time t. If Chef faces an opening bracket, he gets hit. However, if he faces a closing bracket, he may choose to let it pass through him (Chef is immune to closing brackets). Chef gets a chance to counter attack Doof as soon as he finds a balanced non-empty bracket sequence. Help Chef by providing him the minimum time x at which he will be able to launch his counter attack. If Chef is unable to counter attack, answer −1−1-1. Formally, you are given a string S of length N consisting only of opening brackets ( and closing brackets ). The substring of S starting at index L and ending at index R, i.e. SLSL+1…SRSLSL+1…SRS_L S_{L+1} ldots S_{R} is denoted by S[L,R]S[L,R]S[L, R] . Consider Q cases. In the ithithi^{text{th}} case, Chef appears at time titit_i (1≤ti≤N)(1≤ti≤N)(1 leq t_i leq N) and faces all characters from index titit_i to N. Find the minimum index x (ti≤x≤N)(ti≤x≤N)(t_i leq x leq N) such that the substring S[ti,x]S[ti,x]S[t_i, x] contains a non-empty balanced bracket subsequence containing the same number of opening brackets as S[ti,x]S[ti,x]S[t_i, x] (i.e., you cannot remove any opening bracket from the substring). If such an x does not exist, print −1−1-1. A string X is called a subsequence of a string Y if it is possible to obtain X by erasing some (possibly zero) characters from Y without changing the order of the remaining characters. A balanced bracket sequence is defined as: an empty string is a balanced bracket sequence. if s is a balanced bracket sequence, then so is (s)(s)(s). if s and t are balanced bracket sequences, then so is ststst.

Dr Phil goes to the ranch ,"Dr. Phil has put you in charge of his new hospital while he is chilling at the ranch. N people have booked appointment with the Doctor today numbered from 1 to N such that person X booked appointment before person Y if X<YX<YX < Y. Now, the people do not necessarily arrive at the hospital on time, so you decide of an unusual way of handling the situation. At the start you fulfill the appointment of the people who booked first (so if person 1 is available then that person can meet the doctor) otherwise you look for next available person. If you fulfill the appointment of any person and their exist some people (1 or more) who have booked earlier but haven’t arrived at the hospital yet, then those people are said to have missed their appointment. If at some point of time there exists a set of people that have missed their appointment earlier and the person who booked appointment most recently among them (later than others in that set) say person X is now available then X is given the priority to meet the doctor over any other person. But even if any person in that set Y other than X is available and X is not available then you start appointments of the people who have not yet missed their appointments in their order of booking.

The Saviours ,"PROBLEM STATEMENT Due to some calamity, all the roads near Banasthali University got damaged. The villages situated near-by began experiencing a shortage of food. Since nobody else was able to help them immediately, Banasthali University took the initiative to supply them with sufficient food till some external help reached the village. Banasthali has it's own flying club which decided to drop food packages to the houses. All the houses in the village are in a straight line. Our pilot, Drishti, was given the responsibility to drop the packages. Consider that all the houses have equal number of members and that one food package can feed two houses. To maintain decorum in the village while dropping the packages, a rule was made. According to this rule, only the next two houses from the position where the package is dropped can feed on that package. Note that, the basic motive is to feed all the houses. Given the way the packages are dropped, can you tell if Drishti was able to distribute food for every house or not? INPUT FORMAT The first line of each input contains 't'- the number of test cases. For each test case, you will be given a string of size 'n'. In the string, '*' represents a package and '0' represents a house. OUTPUT FORMAT For every test case, print 'YES' if all the dropped packages will be able to feed all the houses; else print 'NO'. CONSTRAINTS 1<=t<=20 1<=n<=10^5 SAMPLE INPUT 2 0*0*00 *00*00 SAMPLE OUTPUT NO YES EXPLANATION In the first case, the package dropped is not received by the first house. In the second case, every 2 houses share a package.

Sed Max ,"JJ has a magical sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,ANA_1, A_2, ldots, A_N. The group of high magicians Sed wants to buy this sequence from him. They calculate its cost as follows: Choose a subarray of length atleast 2, i.e. a contiguous subsequence Al,Al+1,…,ArAl,Al+1,…,ArA_l, A_{l+1}, ldots, A_r such that 1≤l<r≤N1≤l<r≤N1 le l lt r le N. The cost is the difference between the largest and the second largest element in this subarray (note that if there is more than one element with the maximum value, the cost is 0). Clearly, the cost is not uniquely determined, but depends on the choice of the subarray in the first step. JJ is careful, so he wants to find the number of different possible amounts of money he can obtain, i.e. the size of the set of all possible costs for all valid choices of this subarray.

Longest non regular parentheses sub-sequence ,"Chef has recently learnt about sequences of parentheses. These are special sequences that contain only the characters '(' and ')'. A regular parentheses sequence follows the following definition: An empty sequence is regular If S is a regular sequence, then (S) is also regular If A and B represent two regular sequences, then their concatenation AB is also regular. Therefore, the sequences (), ()() and (())() are regular, while ()(, ) and ))() are non-regular. Now, you need to find the longest subsequence of the given sequence which is non-regular. Amongst all such distinct answers, output the lexicographically Kth amongst them. If the number of distinct subsequences with maximum length is less than K, please output -1 instead.

Transmutation Diamonds ,"In the nation of Amestris, people use transmutation circles for Alchemy, but in different regions of the world people have come up with different methods to harness the power of Alchemy. In the nation of Creta, people use transmutation figures in the shape of a Diamond for Alchemy. Refer to the figure below to understand what a Diamond shape is. The Elric brothers come to Creta to learn this form of Alchemy. For this Alchemy, the energy from the earth is used to deconstruct and reconstruct. Now Edward is standing on a piece of land, which can be considered to be a grid of dimensions N×NN×NN times N. For every block of land, the energy it provides in Alchemy is given as EijEijE_{ij}. It is also possible for some block to have negative energy, in which case it reduces the power of transmutation diamond. The power of transmutation from a diamond figure is the sum of the energies ( EijEijE_{ij} ) of the blocks included in the transmutation diamond. Given that the diamond figure must lie inside the grid, find the maximum power that can be generated from any diamond transmutation figure. Note that you have to select at least one block. The above figure shows the smallest three diamonds shapes that can be formed in the grid.

Covering Sets ,"Let's consider a set S of N different elements numbered from 0 to N - 1. It's a well-known fact that there are exactly 2N subsets of S (including the empty subset). Each subset S' of S can be encoded as a bitmask B(S') containing N bits, where the i'th bit of B(S') is equal to 1 if the i'th element of S belongs to S', and 0 otherwise. Each bitmask can also be considered as a non-negative integer represented in binary. For example, suppose N is equal to 5. Then S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. Let's assume S' = {0, 3, 4}. Then B(S') = 1 × 20 + 0 × 21 + 0 × 22 + 1 × 23 + 1 × 24 = 110012 = 2510. Let's say that a triple (A, B, C) of subsets of S covers a subset D of S, if D is a subset of the union of subsets A, B and C. In other words, every element of D is an element of at least one of A, B, or C. Let's consider four functions F, G, H and R. Each takes a subset of S as the only parameter and returns a non-negative integer. You are given the values of F(i), G(i), and H(i) for each 0 ≤ i < 2N. The value of the function R of a subset X of S is equal to the sum of F(A) × G(B) × H(C) for all triples (A, B, C) of subsets of S that cover X. Your task is to calculate R(0) + R(1) + . + R(2N - 1) modulo 1007(109 + 7).

War in Treeland Again ,"There is a full-scale war taking place in Treeland. Chef needs to travel between cities in Treeland to work, but during the war, it is not safe.

Chess Match ,"In a Chess match ""a + b"", each player has a clock which shows a minutes at the start and whenever a player makes a move, b seconds are added to this player's clock. Time on a player's clock decreases during that player's turns and remains unchanged during the other player's turns. If the time on some player's clock hits zero (but not only in this case), this player loses the game. There's a 3 + 2 blitz chess match.

Bear and Shuffled Points ,"Bear Limak loves preparing problems for algorithmic contests. While his favorite part is inventing a story and writing the statement, he doesn't really like creating the test data. Not only it's hard to do, but also making a mistake may spoil a problem completely, likely making a problem easier. Limak prepared the following problem for you. You start with an empty set of points on a two-dimensional plane. There are N queries, each with one new point (xi, yi) to insert to the set. After each query you must find the diameter of the set, i.e. the maximum distance between two points in the set. To avoid printing floating numbers, after each query print the square of the diameter. In many problems, in test generators an author should create some (possibly smart and tricky) data, and then shuffle it before printing. Limak did the same in this problem, not noticing how crucial it may be. You can assume that in every test the N points are randomly shuffled. In other words, generators have a line ""random_shuffle(array with points)"" just before printing. It isn't guaranteed that a problem is solvable within the time limit without this extra constraint.

Mutated Minions ,"Gru has not been in the limelight for a long time and is, therefore, planning something particularly nefarious. Frustrated by his minions' incapability which has kept him away from the limelight, he has built a transmogrifier — a machine which mutates minions. Each minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer. The transmogrifier adds an integer K to each of the minions' characteristic value. Gru knows that if the new characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like mutations. Given the initial characteristic integers of N minions, all of which are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.

Easy Fibonacci ,"The Fibonacci sequence F0,F1,…F0,F1,…F_0, F_1, ldots is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where F0=0F0=0F_0 = 0, F1=1F1=1F_1 = 1 and for each integer n≥2n≥2n ge 2, Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}. Consider the sequence D of the last decimal digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers, i.e. D=(F0%10,F1%10,…,FN−1%10)D=(F0%10,F1%10,…,FN−1%10)D = (F_0 % 10, F_1 % 10, ldots, F_{N-1} % 10). Now, you should perform the following process: Let D=(D1,D2,…,Dl)D=(D1,D2,…,Dl)D = (D_1, D_2, ldots, D_l). If l=1l=1l = 1, the process ends. Create a new sequence E=(D2,D4,…,D2⌊l/2⌋)E=(D2,D4,…,D2⌊l/2⌋)E = (D_2, D_4, ldots, D_{2 lfloor l/2 rfloor}). In other words, E is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from D.

Version Control System ,"<meta charset=""utf8"" /> A version control system(VCS) is a repository of files, often the files for the source code of computer programs, with monitored access. Every change made to the source is tracked, along with who made the change, why they made it, and references to problems fixed, or enhancements introduced, by the change. Version control systems are essential for any form of distributed, collaborative development. Whether it is the history of a wiki page or large software development project, the ability to track each change as it was made, and to reverse changes when necessary can make all the difference between a well managed and controlled process and an uncontrolled ‘first come, first served’ system. It can also serve as a mechanism for due diligence for software projects. In this problem we'll consider a simplified model of a development project. Let's suppose, that there are N source files in the project. All the source files are distinct and numbered from 1 to N. A VCS, that is used for maintaining the project, contains two sequences of source files. The first sequence contains the source files, that are ignored by the VCS. If a source file is not in the first sequence, then it's considered to be unignored. The second sequence contains the source files, that are tracked by the VCS. If a source file is not in the second sequence, then it's considered to be untracked. A source file can either be or not be in any of these two sequences. Your task is to calculate two values: the number of source files of the project, that are both tracked and ignored, and the number of source files of the project, that are both untracked and unignored.

Chef and Memory Limit ,"Recently Chef has decided to make some changes in our beloved Codechef. As you know, each problem at Codechef has its memory and time limits. To make problems even more challenging, he decided to measure allocated memory in a different way. Now judge program will be calculating not the maximum memory usage during the execution of all test files, but all the memory ever allocated by the solution program. But as Chef is not that good in algorithms, so he asks you to write a program that will calculate total memory usage of a solution. So, you are given N numbers M1, , ,MN representing the measurements of consumed memory (in MBs) for N test files. In other terms, it means that on i-th test file, program took Mi MBs of memory. Initially, there is no memory allocated for your program. Before running your program on each test file, if the currently allocated memory is more than memory needed for the current test file, then there will be a deallocation of the memory to fit the current program. Also, if there is less than needed memory available, then allocation of memory will happen so as to fit the current program. e.g. Let us say that our program took 10 MBs on current test file. So, assuming if there was 12 MBs memory allocated before running the program on current test file, then there will happen a deallocation of 2 MBs. Assuming if there was 8 MBs memory allocated before running the program on current test file, then there will happen a allocation of 2 MBs. Calculate the total memory allocated for running the solution program on all the N test files. Please see third sample for more clarity.

Road Decoration ,"Australia and New Zealand have started working on preparation for the World Cup 2015. There are N important venues (like hotels and stadiums) in the city. Out of these important venues, there is one central location where the opening and closing ceremony will be held. There is an existing network of bidirectional roads connecting these venues. The organizing committee has planned to decorate some of these roads that will be used for commuting. They have decided to choose the roads to decorate such that there is exactly one decorated path to all the venues from the central location. New Zealand is supposed to decorate these roads and Australia has taken up the responsibility of providing transportation. Only decorated roads can be used for transportation. Australia wanted to save fuel costs, and so they wanted to choose the decorated roads to minimize the total sum of distances to all venues from the central location. However, New Zealand had their own plans to minimize decoration cost by choosing the decorated roads such that the sum of the length of the chosen roads will be minimized. To prevent a fight breaking out between these two rivals before they even step on to the field, you have to help them by reporting if there is a solution in which the two rivals could choose the same set of roads while satisfying their respective constraints.

There are N towns in country. ith town is at height H[i] (1 ≤ i ≤ N) above the sea level. Changing mode of the car requires permissions from mayor of the town you are currently at. Mayor of ith town charges amount C[i] (1 ≤ i ≤ n) for giving permission to change mode of the car. These N towns are connected by R bidirectional roads. Initially no mode is set, so you need permissions to set a mode. You have to travel from town 1 to N, in minimum amount of cost. Print minimum money required to make the travel. If it is impossible print -1. Note: Go up the road mode: when you are at town A and want to go to town B, where H[A] <= H[B] Go down the road mode: when you are at town A and want to go to town B, where H[A] >= H[B] If you continue with the same mode, you do not need to take permissions from mayor.

India Fights Corona ,"There are N cities (numbered from 1 to N) and M bidirectional roads. The ithithi^{th} of these roads connects the cities AiAiA_i and BiBiB_i and has a length of DiDiD_i Km. There are only K cities that have a hospital for corona testing. The cost of corona testing may be different in different cities. For each city, we want to know the minimum cost that needs to be spent to test a corona sample. If city you are in contains a hospital and you choose to test in that hospital itself, then the cost incurred is the cost of corona test in that hospital. Otherwise, if you choose to test in a hospital in another city, then an additional transportation cost is also incurred (Assuming Rs.1 per Km). So from a city i, if you choose to send a sample to city j, then the total cost incurred will be Cj+D(i,j)Cj+D(i,j)C_j + D(i,j). Here CjCjC_j denotes the cost of corona testing in a hospital situated in city j and D(i,j)D(i,j)D(i,j) denotes the minimum distance between city i and j via some road network. Output the minimum money that should be spent by a person in each of the N cities for testing a corona sample. It is guaranteed that there is a path from every city to every other city. Also, there is at most one road between any pair of cities (i.e. no multiple edges). There are no roads from one city to itself (i.e. no self-loops). Note: Since the inputs and outputs are large, prefer using fast input-output methods. Tags: Dijkstra's Algorithm Algorithms, Graph Algos, Shortest Paths ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/CORONA,CC
Efficient Delivery ,"Every day he has a number of deliveries to be completed. Sergey lives in Bytetown - a city, consisting of N junctions, and M roads connecting these junctions. More precisely, the ith road connects the junctions with the numbers Xi and Yi. Each of these roads has its own (positive) length Zi, and no road connects a junction to itself. There are K delivery orders for Sergey. Each order is denoted with four integers: Aj, Bj, Vj and Cj. It means that for the jth order Sergey has to pick a parcel of weight Vj at the junction numbered Aj and deliver it to the junction numbered Bj. After the parcel is delivered, Sergey gets Cj burles of reward. Sergey can't complete the same order twice or more times. So, the business day for Sergey looks as follows: he remembers the whole list of orders and starts at his initial junction numbered S. Then, he travel the streets of the city via his bike. If Sergey visits a junction, where there is one or more orders available he can either take some of the orders and load the corresponding parcels on his bike, or not take anything now but do it later, if he appears at the same junction again. When Sergey visits a junction which is the destination for some of the parcels that are currently with him, he can complete these orders and unload the corresponding parcels. Sadly, Sergey is not infinitely strong. Though he can carry any number of parcels at once, if the total weight of the parcels exceeds W Sergey won't be able to carry them on his bike. Sergey also can't take a parcel and not deliver it because there will be complains, hurting Sergey's reputation. The bike has enough fuel to travel only for D units of distance. It is not necessary for Sergey to get back to his initial junction because he has a lot of friends in Bytetown who will drop him back after the party (Sorry, you're not invited). It is clear that under the given constraints, Sergey might be not able to deliver all the parcels. So your task is to plan the delivery for Sergey in such a way that: He moves only by streets The total travelled distance doesn't exceed D. There are no undelivered parcels with Sergey by the end of the delivery. In other words, all the parcels that Sergey has picked up should be delivered. At any time, Sergey does not carry more than W units of weight. The most important: the profit Sergey gets by the end of the day is maximized. You don't have to find the optimal delivery, but the more profit there is, the more are the points you'll get.

Planetary Path ,"In order to expand its reach to the outer universe and ensure universal peace, the MIB has decided to expand its offices. Namely, it has established its office on N most important planets in the universe, with the base station on the planet S. Each office has an intergalactic teleporter that connects it to other planet offices. But the teleporters are bound to a planet's policy, so you cannot teleport to any planet you wish. Due to intergalactic feuds, the planets are divided into K different alliances, numbered 1 through K. You know for each planet i, the alliance that it belongs to. In other words, you're given a sequence A1,A2,…,AnA1,A2,…,AnA_{1}, A_{2}, dots, A_{n}, which says that planet i belongs to alliance AiAiA_{i}. Each planet i has a policy of teleportation to the planets of other alliances: Cost to travel from one planet to another is determined by the alliance of the destination planet. More formally, the cost to reach a planet which belongs to alliance j from planet i is represented as Ci,jCi,jC_{i, j}. Intra-alliance travel is free, i.e., if Ai=jAi=jA_{i} = j, then Ci,j=0Ci,j=0C_{i, j} = 0. For a planet i, there are some forbidden alliances as well. For these alliances, Ci,j=−1Ci,j=−1C_{i, j} = -1, given that alliance j is forbidden to travel from planet i. As MIB is bound to follow the intergalactic rules and since they have limited funds (yes, the government is cheap everywhere), they have decided to find the most optimal way to travel to each of the planets from the base station at planet S. With all other agents busy with their missions, you are assigned the task to find these minimum-cost paths. This is your first task in MIB, so don't let them down!

The players play in rounds. In each round, both Alex and Fedor make a move. Alex moves first. When a player makes a move, he needs to provide a permutation P of integer from 1 to N such that the number of inversions in this permutation is even for Alex (similarly odd for Fedya) and all the cells with the coordinates (i, Pi) in the matrix are black.

The Malaysian Flight Search ,"Problem description. Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared on March 8th with 239 people aboard. After a lot of theories and extensive search, the Prime Minister of Malaysia declared that the flight was crashed in the Indian Ocean. After gathering information, the area where the Black Box is present has been identified. The Black Box has a signal transmitter which responds to a special kind of signal. We have search planes which can go to a particular location, and send the special kind of signal in all directions to a certain range. If the Black Box receives that signal, it will respond back. As the location of crash is very far from nearest land and the cost to operate planes are high, Officials would like to minimize the total cost of this search operation. You are to write a program to help them For the purpose of this problem, we consider 2-D coordinate system, forget about the depth of Indian Ocean and the following are true: We have many planes with us, each plane is defined by 3 variables (I, R, C). I is the unique id of the plane. R is the range it can transmit the special signal. C is the amount of Rupees (Yes, we are operating from India) required for one unit of travel. All the planes are present at (0,0). Same plane can be used any number of times. All the distances we consider in this problem are Manhattan distance. Distance between (a,b) and (c,d) is abs(a-c)+abs(b-d). Given the plane id, and coordinates (x,y) from where it has to transmit the special signal, the plane moves from (0,0) to (x,y), transmits the signal, records the reply from Black Box if any, and returns to (0,0) Cost of above operation would be sum of costs for (0,0) to (x,y) and (x,y) to (0,0), i.e, 2*(x+y)*C Rupees Black Box at position (a,b) responds to special signal from a plane at (x,y) with range r if abs(a-x) + abs(b-y) <= r We always have a plane with R = 0. The Black Box need not be present inside the search area. It is possible that the Officials got wrong search area. Note that the Black Box can still respond to special signals. This is an Interactive Problem, you will be given details of all available planes, and description of area inside which the Black Box is expected to be present. You need to issue commands of the form (I, x, y) which means that you would like to send plane with id I to position (x, y) and give the special signal. The automated judge will respond with ""yes"" or ""no"", ""yes"" if the Black Box responded, ""no"" otherwise.

There is a hidden cell (a,b)(a,b)(a, b). It is known that this cell doesn't lie on the boundary of the matrix. That is, min(a,b)≥1min(a,b)≥1min(a, b) geq 1 and max(a,b)<N−1max(a,b)<N−1max(a, b) < N - 1. Your task is to recover the hidden cell. You can ask queries, in which you give the judge a matrix M of size N×NN×NN times N, consisting of zeroes and ones. Let's call a cell (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) valid if (i,j)=(a,b)(i,j)=(a,b)(i, j) = (a, b) or Mi,j=1Mi,j=1M_{i,j} = 1. The judge replies whether there exists a path from (0,0)(0,0)(0, 0) to (N−1,N−1)(N−1,N−1)(N - 1, N - 1) consisting of only valid cells, moving only down and right. Formally, it tells whether there exits a sequence of 2N−12N−12N - 1 cells (0=u0,0=v0),(u1,v1),…,(N−1=u2N−2,N−1=v2N−2)(0=u0,0=v0),(u1,v1),…,(N−1=u2N−2,N−1=v2N−2)(0 = u_0, 0 = v_0), (u_1, v_1), ldots, (N - 1 = u_{2N-2}, N - 1 = v_{2N-2}), such that (ui,vi)(ui,vi)(u_i, v_i) is a valid cell for all i and either (ui+1=ui,vi+1=vi+1)(ui+1=ui,vi+1=vi+1)(u_{i + 1} = u_i, v_{i + 1} = v_i + 1) or (ui+1=ui+1,vi+1=vi)(ui+1=ui+1,vi+1=vi)(u_{i + 1} = u_i + 1, v_{i + 1} = v_i). The score of your submission is a function of the number of queries asked. Please refer to the scoring section for more details. Note that the grader is not adaptive, which means that the hidden cell is fixed in the beginning and won't change according to the queries you ask.

Codechef Password Recovery ,"Chef recently decided a very curious encryption algorithm for CodeChef passwords. He took an N-letter password and found all the possible 2-letter substrings, considering the characters of a password was written in a circle. Thus, for AbcD, he would deduce the following substrings: Ab, bc, cD, DA. Then, some of the substrings were reversed. For example, the set of substrings above could be converted to Ab, cb, Dc, DA. All the substrings were then stored in a database. Whenever the need be, the substrings were recovered, and a password was generated. Of course sometimes, more than one such password could be generated, but Chef thinks this is perfectly fine! Unfortunately, a programming error by the new CodeChef minion, led to corruption of this database and mixed all the strings together. Chef now wants to retrieve the passwords, a few at a time. He gives you a set of substrings A from some of the passwords - these you should always consider, and another set of substrings B from which you can use some. Can you tell him if it is possible to select all the substrings from A and some (0 or more) substrings from B and construct 1 or more passwords? Each selected string can be used only once, for at max 1 password.

Rook Path ,"There is a chessboard with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and N columns (numbered 1 through N). M squares on this chessboard (numbered 1 through M) are marked. For each valid i, the i-th of the marked squares is in the ririr_i-th row and cicic_i-th column. You should perform the following process: First, you take a rook and put this rook on one of the marked squares. Then you move the rook M−1M−1M-1 times; since it is a rook, each of these moves must be to a marked square in the same row or the same column as the square where the rook was currently standing. The rook must visit each of the marked squares exactly once. In each move, squares strictly between those where the rook stands immediately before and after this move are not visited by the rook. Also, the directions of the moves must alternate ― you may not move the rook in the same row twice or in the same column twice in any two consecutive moves. Find one valid path for the rook that visits the marked squares. It is guaranteed that at least one such path exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.

Merge Sort ,"You must be aware of the sorting technique, called merge sort where we sort an input array by first dividing it into two halves, and then sorting the each half recursively before finally merging these sorted halves. A GEU student, Mohan want to understand this recursive algorithm more clearly and is interested to know how the recursive function calls are getting called during the merge sort program execution for the given input parameters - input array (A), begin index (s) and the end index (t). When the function merge_sort(A,s,t) is called, the recursive functions calls would be executed as per the input parameters. Mohan is interested to take a snapshot of the function calling stack when merge_sort(A,i,i) is being executed, where s <= i <= t. Mohan also wants to know the recursive function depth at that point of time. Assume that, if the input array consists of odd number of elements then it is divide in such a way that the left half contains one element more than the right half.

More formally: if we put lengths of all edges from the path into an array and sort it, then the Chef length of this path is the median of this array (element in the middle of the sorted array, and if we have two elements in the middle of the array, then the median is the bigger one). For example, if the array equals {3, 7, 9}, then its median is 7, and if the array equals {1, 2, 3, 4}, then the median is 3.

Querying on a Grid ,"Chef is helping out at a volunteering center for teaching. A child comes to Chef with a problem that he is not able to solve and asks Chef for his help. The problem is the following: Consider an M × N grid graph. The vertices in the grid graph are identified by its row and column number, i.e., for a vertex there are two numbers (i,j) associated with it, where 1 ≤ i ≤ M is its row, and 1 ≤ j ≤ N is its column. There are two types of edges in a grid graph(note that all edges are bidirectional) : When i < M, there is an edge of weight down(i, j) connecting (i, j) and (i+1, j); When j < N, there is an edge of weight right(i, j) connecting (i, j) and (i, j+1). Initially, every vertex has a weight of zero. Define the length of a path to be the sum of weights of all the edges in this path. The shortest path between (i1, j1) and (i2, j2) is the path with the minimum length. Of course, the weights associated with vertices doesn't influence shortest paths at all. The task in the problem is to process the following 2 types of queries on this graph efficiently : i1 j1 i2 j2 c : add c to the weights of all vertices in the shortest path between (i1, j1) and (i2, j2). i j : return the weight of vertex (i, j).

Tasty Dishes ,"Chef's restaurant is the most attractive place to have dinner at. To understand why, let's have a look at a way customers do their orders: There is only one list of N ingredients in the menu. Every ingredient has its beauty value that does not depend on its taste, but on the way it looks, which is expressed as a positive integer. To order a dish, the customer asks Chef to use all the ingredients from L to R (L is strictly less than R). Chef knows that the dish will be tasty and not only beautiful if the sum of its ingredients' beauty values is divisible by K. Chef does not want to use all the ingredients, so he always excludes one of them. Which one? - The least beautiful one! (in other words - which has the minimal beauty value).

Different Trips ,"The Chef is enjoying a wonderful vacation in Byteland. What makes the Chef impressed the most is the road system of the country. Byteland has N cities numbered 1 through N. City 1 is the capital of Byteland. The country also has N-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities. The i-th road connects two different cities ui and vi. In this road system, people can travel between every pair of different cities by going through exactly one path of roads. The roads are arranged in such a way that people can distinguish two cities only when both cities have different number of roads connected to it. Such two cities will be considered similar. For example, city A is similar to the capital if the number of roads connected to city A is equal to the number of roads connected to the capital. On each day during the vacation, the Chef wants to have a trip as follows. He chooses two cities A and B such that the Chef will visit city B if he goes from A to the capital using the shortest path. Then, the Chef will visit the cities on the shortest path from A to B through this path. Please note that A may be equal to B; that means the Chef will enjoy the day in a single city. The Chef does not want to have similar trips. Two trips are considered similar if and only if they both have the same number of visited cities and for each i, the i-th city visited in one trip is similar to the i-th city visited in the other trip.

(Challenge) Building Anthills ,"The queen of ants hired Ada to build their anthill. Ada designed the anthill as N rooms (numbered 1 through N) interconnected by M bidirectional roads (numbered 1 through M). For simplicity, let's denote a road that connects rooms u and v by (u,v)(u,v)(u, v). At any time, there may be at most one road between any two rooms and roads connecting a room with itself are not allowed. Ada started from scratch by building the N rooms and choosing the M roads that should be built. In order to create the roads, she wants to give instructions to the ants and pay them in antcoins (a very small currency). There are two possible types of instructions: K, E={(x1,y1),(x2,y2),…,(xK,yK)}E={(x1,y1),(x2,y2),…,(xK,yK)}E = {(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), ldots, (x_K,y_K)}: Let E be a set of K distinct roads. The ants should build all roads in the set E that do not already exist. Moreover, for every three distinct rooms u, v and w, if (u,v)∈E(u,v)∈E(u, v) in E and (v,w)∈E(v,w)∈E(v, w) in E, then the ants should also build the road (u,w)(u,w)(u, w) if it does not already exist. The cost of this instruction is A⋅KA⋅KA cdot K antcoins. u, v: The ants should remove the road (u,v)(u,v)(u, v) if it exists. The cost of this instruction is R antcoins. After all the instructions are executed, only the planned M roads should be built. Help Ada build the anthill while spending as few antcoins as possible.

Netcoin Verification ,"Due to demonitization move, normal people went to ATMs for fetching the cash, some went for cashless transactions. Many people have already started using netcoins. In netcoins, each transaction is represented by a block. For a transaction to be accepted, its block has to be added to a chain of verified blocks. The coder of netcoin is very suspicious, so when a new block is added to the verified chain, the entire chain is verified again. You are given the time taken to verify each block. It is guaranteed that all the verification times are distinct. Hacker Shanker has done some black money transactions hidden across N given blocks. These transaction will only be detected when all the N blocks are verified. Netcoins uses a rather simple algorithm to figure out the order in which to add the given N transactions into a new, empty verified chain. It takes an array of N transactions as input and keeps 2 pointers - one initially at the beginning and another initially at the end. It then compares the block pointed by the 2 pointers and adds the block which requires the lesser verification time to the verified chain. Once this block has been added, the entire verified chain is verified again, spending time equal to the sum of the verification times of each block in the current verified chain. The corresponding pointer is moved, so that, both the pointers always point to the leftmost and rightmost unverified blocks in the array given to the algorithm. Hacker Shanker wants to escape and hide. For that he needs as much time as possible before all the N transactions are verified. For that he can order the N transactions however he wants and then send the array as input to the algorithm. He wants to find out the maximum amount of time taken to verify all the N transactions, among all the possible orderings of the array.

(Challenge) Bacteria Synthesis ,"Chef Ada always prepares delicious and nutritious dishes. Her secret is to use genetic engineering of bacteria to synthesise proteins. A protein is denoted by a string of uppercase English characters 'A'-'T'; each character represents an amino acid. The genome of Ada's bacteria is also denoted by a string with length N. Each character of this string is 'A', 'C', 'T' or 'G', representing a nucleotide. The nucleotides are also numbered 1 through 4 in the same order 'A', 'C', 'T', 'G'. Let's denote the number of a nucleotide x by n(x)n(x)n(x). You are given the starting genome G of Ada's bacteria; at any point, all bacteria must have the same genome. You may perform operations of the following types (in any order, any number of times): 1 L R: Reverse the substring between the L-th and R-th character inclusive (1≤L≤R≤N1≤L≤R≤N1 le L le R le N), i.e. for each L≤i<L+R−i≤RL≤i<L+R−i≤RL le i lt L+R-i le R, swap the i-th and L+R−iL+R−iL+R-i-th nucleotide of the current genome. The cost of this operation is K+min(L−1,R−L,N−R)K+min(L−1,R−L,N−R)K + mathrm{min},(L-1, R-L, N-R) chefcoins. 2 i Y: Mutate, i.e. change the i-th nucleotide of the current genome (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N1 le i le N) to the nucleotide Y. The cost of this operation is A+min(i,N+1−i)⋅Bn(X),n(Y)A+min(i,N+1−i)⋅Bn(X),n(Y)A + mathrm{min},(i, N+1-i) cdot B_{n(X), n(Y)} chefcoins, where X denotes the i-th nucleotide before this mutation. Each amino acid is encoded by one or more codons ― a codon is a string of three nucleotides. Each codon encodes exactly one amino acid. Note that there are 43434^3 different codons and only 202020 amino acids. For each codon, you are given the amino acid it encodes. A bacteria can produce a protein P with length L amino acids if its genome contains a substring of 3⋅L3⋅L3 cdot L nucleotides that can be translated to P, i.e. split into a sequence of L consecutive substrings Z1,Z2,…,ZLZ1,Z2,…,ZLZ_1, Z_2, ldots, Z_L with lengths 3 such that for each i (1≤i≤L1≤i≤L1 le i le L), ZiZiZ_i is a codon for the i-th amino acid (character) of P. For example, let's suppose that codons ""ATA"" and ""TAT"" are translated to amino acids 'R' and 'S' respectively. Then, a bacteria with a genome ""ATATATA"" can produce only the following proteins (the codons used to produce them are marked by brackets): ""[ATA]TATA"" to ""R"" ""A[TAT]ATA"" to ""S"" ""[ATA][TAT]A"" to ""RS"" ""A[TAT][ATA]"" to ""SR"" For her next dish, Ada needs M proteins P1,P2,…,PMP1,P2,…,PMP_1, P_2, ldots, P_M. Her bacteria do not have to produce all proteins, since they can be bought on the market; for each valid i, the cost of the protein PiPiP_i is CiCiC_i chefcoins. However, Ada wants the final bacteria to be able to synthesise at least 505050 of the required proteins. As her apprentice, your task is to perform some (possibly zero) genetic operations on the initial genome and decide which proteins should be produced from the resulting genome; all other proteins are bought on the market.

Find the Special Node ,"This is an interactive task There is a tree consisting of N nodes. A certain node X is marked as special, but you don't know X - your task is to find it. To achieve this, you can ask queries to obtain information about X. To be specific, you can ask queries in the form: ? Y where 1≤Y≤N1≤Y≤N1 le Y le N, and you will be provided with a random node on the path from node Y to node X, excluding Y. If Y=XY=XY = X you will receive −1−1-1 instead. You can ask at most 121212 queries. Find the special node X. Note: The judge is not adaptive, i.e, node X is chosen at the start before any interaction happens and does not change based on the queries you ask. Interaction Begin the interaction by reading a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The test cases follow. For each test case, first read a single integer N denoting the number of nodes in the tree. N−1N−1N - 1 lines follow. The ithithi^{th} of these lines contains two space-separated integers uiuiu_i and viviv_i, denoting an edge between the nodes uiuiu_i and viviv_i. After this, you can start making queries. To ask a query, output ? Y (1≤Y≤N1≤Y≤N1 le Y le N). The judge will return some node (other than Y) which lies on the path between node Y and node X, or −1−1-1 if Y=XY=XY = X. To output the answer, output ! X, where X is the special node that is hidden. This is not considered a query. If at any time you make an invalid query or exceed the query limit, the interaction is terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

The query ? 1 gives −1−1-1. A query returns −1−1-1 only if Y=XY=XY = X, hence we can answer X=1X=1X = 1. Test case 2: X=3X=3X = 3. The query ? 1 gives node 2 which is in the path from node 1 to node 3 excluding node 1. That is the path between node 2 to node 3. The query ? 2 gives node 3 which is in the path from node 2 to node 4 excluding node 2. That is the path between node 3 to node 3. The query ? 3 gives −1−1-1 as Y=XY=XY = X in this case, hence we can answer node 3. NOTE: The above queries are just to demonstrate the interaction. They may or may not be sufficient to deduce the final answer.

Move the Coins 2 ,"This is a sequel to the problem ""Move the Coins"" with a couple of twists! Alice and Bob are playing a board game. The board is a tree TboardTboardT_{textit{board}} with N nodes (numbered 1 through N). The game involves moving some coins around the board. For a node R (1≤R≤N1≤R≤N1 le R le N), let's define a game g(Tboard,R)g(Tboard,R)g(T_{textit{board}}, R) with the following rules: Initially, a copy of TboardTboardT_{textit{board}} is taken and for each valid v, cvcvc_v coins are placed in the node v. Bob and Alice alternate turns; Alice plays first. In each turn, the current player must take a single coin from some node other than R (let's denote it by C) and move it to another node which lies on the path between R and C (including R, but not including C). If a player cannot move a coin during their turn (i.e. all the coins are in the node R), this player loses the game. For example, for the board in the figure below and R=1R=1R=1: The current player may take a coin from one of the nodes 2, 4 or 5 (if there were any coins in node 3, taking one of those would also be an option). If they take a coin from node 5, they can move it X steps towards the node R=1R=1R=1, where X is either 1, 2 or 3 and the coin ends up in the node 4, 2 or 1, respectively: Let's assume that they pick X=2X=2X=2, so they move the coin to node 2. At the end of this turn, the board is and it is the other player's turn. Both players play optimally. Bob knows some elementary Game Theory, so he is able to very quickly predict the winner of any game. Unimpressed, Alice gives him a harder task: she challenges him to find the winner of g(Tboard,R)g(Tboard,R)g(T_{textit{board}}, R) for each valid R (1≤R≤N1≤R≤N1 le R le N). Can you help Bob figure out the answer? Specifically, if W is the set of all valid R such that the winner of g(Tboard,R)g(Tboard,R)g(T_{textit{board}}, R) is Bob, then you must calculate ∑R∈W2R∑R∈W2Rsum_{R in W} 2^R modulo 109+7109+710^9+7.

Random Walk Queries ,"Chef visited his native country Chefland for vacation. Chefland has N towns (numbered 1 through N) and N−1N−1N-1 bidirectional roads connecting the towns in such a way that it is possible to travel from each town to any other town. Chef had a series of Q tasks he wanted to perform in Chefland. There are two types of tasks: 1 u d: Chef should make a random walk with a maximum length d, starting from town u. 2 u: Write down the number of times Chef has visited town u so far. A random walk with the above parameters (u,d)(u,d)(u,d) is made in the following way: First, Chef visits town u. Then, he uniformly randomly chooses a neighbouring town of the town he is currently in (a town directly connected to it by a road), which has not been visited so far, and moves to it (visits it). If there is no such town or he has already travelled a distance d (visited d+1d+1d+1 towns), the walk ends. Otherwise, Chef continues from step 2 again. However, there is an issue ― Chef quickly forgets the exact paths he has travelled. Hence, he cannot write down exact numbers in tasks of the second type. He would like you to at least tell him, for each task of the second type, the expected value of the number he would write down in this task. Help Chef and find these expected values. Note that Chef's sequence of tasks is encoded so that they have to be processed online. It can be proved that at any point, the expected number of times a city is visited can be expressed as a fraction PQPQfrac{P}{Q}, where P and Q are non-negative integers and Q is coprime with 109+7109+710^9+7.

The Counties ,"The map of Ancient ChefLand can be represented as a graph with N nodes, denoting the cities and N-1 edges, denoting the roads connecting these cities. It was possible to get from any city of Ancient ChefLand to any other one using only these roads, possibly, via some intermediate cities in a unique simple path. So, in other words, the city-road structure of this country could be represented as a tree. There were M counties in the ChefLand, numbered 1 through M. Each county had a country, consisting of at least one city. Because of the constant wars between the counties, it was not guaranteed that it is possible to get from one city of the county to any other city of this county only via the cities, belonging to the county. Sometimes, the counties were in battles against each other. The battle could be defined by a pair of integers (Vi and Ci), denoting that the counties Ci attacked a city Vi. Sometimes, the counties could attack their own cities, by a mistake. Sergey studies the history of Ancient ChefLand. Now he read about the attacks of the cities and now he wonders to know the distance to the closest city to the attacked one, which belongs to the attacker county.

Sebi and the corrupt goverment ,"Sebi lives in Chefland where the government is extremely corrupt that usually makes fool out of public by announcing eye catching but non-sustainable schemes. Recently there was a move to increase tourism in the country that was highly lauded. Sebi wants to examine whether the move has some potential or is a hogwash as usual. The Chefland is a city with very old road infrastructure. The city has N tourist places. All the places are reachable from each other. The corrupt administrators of the city constructed as few roads as possible just ensuring that all the places are reachable from each other, and those too have now gone old with potholes every here and there. Upon this, there is a toll tax for each road too, which you have to pay once for using that road. Once you pay the tax for a road, you can visit it again as many times as possible. The tourists coming to Chefland usually want to see all the N nice places. They usually have visit in their own vehicle and stay for few days. Also, they are usually not very rich, they want to pay as less toll tax as possible. For promoting tourism, the government offered their citizens a scheme. It was announced that citizens can choose any two places and the government will build a high class road between those two places and that too without any toll tax. Note that citizens may choose to have a high class road between two cities which already have an old road between them. Sebi is very sceptical of the claims of the announcement. So, he wants to understand the expected toll tax a tourist has to pay to tour the entire city considering that the citizens of Chefland vote for the two cities for constructing high road uniformly randomly.

In other words, you are given a complete bipartite graph where each edge occurs with some probability. Your task is to find the expected size of the maximum matching of this graph. What exactly does it mean? Let's call our complete bipartite graph with random edges as random bipartite graph. Consider some arbitrary bipartite graph G = (U, V, E). Denote by P(G) the probability that our random bipartite graph is equal to G. How to calculate P(G)? Consider some pair of vertexes (U[i], V[j]). If these vertexes are connected by the edge in G then put PG[i][j] = P[i][j] otherwise put PG[i][j] = 1 – P[i][j]. Then P(G) is equal to the product of PG[i][j] for all N ∙ M pairs of (i, j), where 1 ≤ i ≤ N and 1 ≤ j ≤ M. Next, denote by MM(G) the size of the maximum matching in the graph G. In other words, MM(G) is the size of the largest set of edges of G such that no two edges share a common vertex. Finally, the expected size of the maximum matching is the sum of products P(G) ∙ MM(G) for all possible bipartite graphs G with parts U and V. Note that there are 2 N ∙ M such graphs in all.

The cost of this operation is the sum of this subarray AL+AL+1+…+ARAL+AL+1+…+ARA_L + A_{L+1} + ldots + A_R before APAPA_P is changed. Find the minimum total cost (sum of costs of individual operations) of making all elements of A equal to 0.

Receipt Recovery ,"While vacationing in Egypt, Chef found a recipe of an ancient dish. The receipt is a sequence of hieroglyphs written on a magic paper - it survived for thousands of years! The sequence is written on a long scroll. Unfortunately, the scroll is split into pieces, and possibly, some pieces of the scroll are missing. Chef has a total of N pieces, numbered for convenience from 1 to N. He gave the pieces of a tape to his friend who studies hieroglyphs for analysis. Chef was happy to hear that there are some relations between the pieces. Some of the pieces may follow other pieces. The informations about these relations is given as a list of M pairs (Ai, Bi). Such a pair means that the Aith piece can be immediately followed by the Bith one. Chef is working on recovering the recipe to prepare this dish for his Egyptian friends. He wants to place all the pieces into lines such that any pair of consecutive pieces (L, R) in a line must be explicitly allowed by one of the M rules described above. In other words, for some i (1 ≤ i ≤ M), (Ai, Bi) = (L, R). It appears that in general, not all the pieces can be placed in a single line while following the rules. So, please help Chef find what is the minimum number of lines required for all the pieces to be placed acoording to the rules.

Two Companies ,"The tram service will start its' work soon in Bytetown - the capital of Byteland. There are N junctions in Bytetown and N-1 tram ways between them. Every tram way connects some two distinct junctions. It's possible to go from any junction to any other one using a sequence of tram ways and there is only one way to go from one junction to another one. So, we can conclude that the graph consisting of junctions as vertices and tram ways as edges is a tree. What has not been decided yet is the set of tram routes. Two companies - BytelandTramService (BTS) and GlobalTramNetworks (GTN) have proposed their own plans of tram routes. Each plan has a number of routes and for every route it has a starting junction, a final junction and the amount of joy that one will get by using this route (that was figured out by the BTS and the GTN analysts). The problem is that these two companies don't cooperate. So, if there's at least one junction that's present at the same time, in the route of BTS and of GTN, there is a risk of collision. The final decision was to choose some subset of the set of BTS's routes and some subset of GTN's routes in such a way that no two routes from the BTS's subset and from the GTN's subset intersect. But BTS's chosen routes can intersect with each other and GTN's chosen routes can intersect with each other. Please, find the maximal possible sum of amounts of joy of the chosen routes.

Electric Town ,"Electric town has only N electricity powerhouses. All these powerhouses do is generate power and transmit it to other powerhouses. Also there are unidirectional power cables between these powerhouses. These cables go in one direction from powerhouse X to powerhouse Y. Each of these cables also have a maximum integral capacity, which is an upper limit on the amount of power they can transfer. These capacities will be given. Now, say a powerhouse receives R amount of power from other powerhouses, and gives out a total of S amount of power out to other powerhouses. Further, suppose it generates G amount of power. Then the amount of power going out of the powerhouse should be the sum of the power it receives, and the power it generates. That is, S = R + G. Since electric town is a very advanced town, G could be anything (non negative). You are Jaylal, a mafia in the town, and you have a special superconducting (again unidirectional) cable. This cable has infinite capacity, and can hence transfer any amount of electricity. You can connect this cable between from powerhouse A to powerhouse B, and since you control this cable, you will obtain the electricity that flows through this cable. You add this cable to the network, and the powerhouses continue to transmit power in the same fashion as before, without noticing that there is another cable. Of course you want to be able to get the maximum electricity. What is the maximum electricity that could be travelling in this cable? You have to answer this question T times, for T different pairs of powerhouses A, B that you connect this cable in. All these answers have to be independently outputted.

Floor Distribution ,"Chef just come up with a very good idea for his business. He needs to hire two group of software engineers. Each group of engineers will work on completely different things and people from different groups don't want to disturb (and even hear) each other. Chef has just rented a whole floor for his purposes in business center ""Cooking Plaza"". The floor is a rectangle with dimensions N over M meters. For simplicity of description the floor's structure, let's imagine that it is split into imaginary squares of size 1x1 called ""cells"". The whole floor is split into rooms (not necessarily rectangular). There are some not noise-resistant walls between some of the cells. Two adjacent cells belong to the same room if they don't have the wall between them. Cells are considered adjacent if and only if they share an edge. Also, we say that relation ""belong to the same room"" is transitive. In other words we say that if cells A and B belong to the same room and B and C belong to the same room then A and C belong to the same room. So we end up having a partition of the floor into rooms. It also means, that each point on the floor belongs to some room. Chef have to distribute the rooms between engineers of two groups. Engineers from the different groups cannot seat in the same room. If engineers from a different groups seat in adjacent rooms, the walls these rooms share have to be noise-resistant. The cost of having one meter of wall isolated is K per month. Due to various reasons Chef has to pay an additional cost for support of each of the room (e.g. cleaning costs money as well). Interesting to know that support cost for a particular room may differ depending on engineers of which group seat in this room. Chef doesn't know the number of people he needs in each group of engineers so he wants to minimize the money he needs to pay for all the floor rent and support. He will see how it goes and then redistribute the floor or find another floor to rent or whatever. Either way, you don't need to care about this. Please pay attention to the restriction that all the rooms should be occupied by engineers of one of the teams. Also, it might happen that all the rooms will be assigned to the same team and this is completely okay.

When each range a.b in the compressed form is decompressed into the subsequence (a,a+1,…,b)(a,a+1,…,b)(a, a+1, ldots, b), we should obtain the (comma-separated) sequence A again. For each maximal contiguous subsequence (a,a+1,…,b)(a,a+1,…,b)(a, a+1, ldots, b) of A such that b≥a+2b≥a+2b ge a+2, the compressed form of A must contain the range a.b; if b≤a+1b≤a+1b le a+1, such a sequence should not be compressed into a range.

The teams in each group are ranked based on the matches they play against each other, according to the following rules: Based on the results of matches, teams are awarded points. Each football match is played between a home team and an away team. If one of the teams scores more goals than the other, this team gains 3 points and the other team gains 0 points. In case of a tie (if both teams score the same number of goals), each of those teams gains 1 point. The goal difference of a team is the number of goals it scored minus the number of goals it received, regardless if it scored/received them as the home team or as the away team. Between any two teams, the team with more points is ranked higher. If they have the same number of points (in case of a tie), the team with higher goal difference is ranked higher.

Treat N as a decimal string. Compute all left shifts of this string N0,N1,…,N|N|−1N0,N1,…,N|N|−1N_0, N_1, ldots, N_{|N|-1} (|N||N||N| denotes the number of digits of N); specifically, NkNkN_k denotes the string formed by moving the first k digits of N to the end in the same order.

Then, F(S,L,R)F(S,L,R)F(S, L, R) is the number of valid pairs (i,i+1)(i,i+1)(i, i + 1) such that Ui=Ui+1Ui=Ui+1U_i = U_{i+1}. As usual, Professor Saeed will give more points to efficient solutions.

ChefWM ,"Chef recently created a new Tiling Window Manager called ChefWM. He wants to find out the maximum number of columns of windows he can fit on the screen and he needs your help. Consider the screen to be an axis-aligned rectangle in the xyxyxy-plane, with its bottom-left corner at (0,0)(0,0)(0, 0) and top-right corner at (N,M)(N,M)(N, M) (that is, the screen has width N units and height M units). works as follows: First, the screen is divided into one or more columns of equal integer width. Then, each column is divided into two or more windows of equal integer height. Note that all windows within a column must have the same height, but windows in different columns may have different heights. Finally, Chef would like the following condition to hold: No two windows from different columns can have their horizontal boundary share the same y-coordinate (apart from y=0y=0y = 0 and y=My=My = M). See the figures below for more details. It is not allowed to leave any empty space on the screen, i.e, the division performed in the first two steps above must cover the entire screen. Here is an example of a tiling that satisfies all the conditions, for N=8N=8N = 8 and M=6M=6M = 6. Below are two tilings that satisfy all conditions except the last. The one on the left has a horizontal edge at y=2y=2y = 2 in both columns, while the one on the right has a horizontal edge at y=2y=2y = 2 in column 1 and column 3. What is the maximum number of columns that can fit on the screen while following the above conditions? Note that you do not need to maximize the number of windows, you only need to maximize the number of columns. It may be possible that no columns can be created under these conditions, in that case, print 0.

Balanced Array ,"Hussain really likes playing with arrays. Today he challenged his friend Farah to beat a game he has invented recently. Hussain will give Farah an array of N positive integers. Farah is allowed to do this move multiple times: Farah can choose three integers (i , j , k) such that k is a positive integer, 1 ≤ i,j ≤ N, and A[i] is divisible by k. Then she should do the following : A[i] = A[i] / k A[j] = A[j] * k That is, she should multiply A[j] by k, and divide A[i] by k. Farah must make all the elements of this array equal, by only performing above move, as many times as she wants. Most of the times, it would be impossible to achieve an array of equal elements. So Farah is allowed to insert at most one element. You can prove that she can always insert an element, so that after the insertion, it becomes possible to make the array elements equal (including the new element), through a series of moves. You have to help Farah find the minimum positive integer that she has to insert into the array so that it's possible for her to make all elements equal after inserting this number.or just tell her that there is no need to insert an additional number.

Hence F(36)=3636=1F(36)=3636=1F(36) = frac{36}{36} = 1. The largest perfect square that divides 7 is 1. Hence F(7)=71=7F(7)=71=7F(7) = frac{7}{1} = 7.

Mr Wireless ,"Mr. Wire Less is not that good at implementing circuit in a breadboard. In his Digital Logic Design course, he has to implement several boolean functions using the breadboard. In a breadboard, inputs are given through the switches and outputs are taken through the LEDs. Each input switch can be either in ground state or in high state. So, if he wishes to implement a boolean function, f(x1, x2, .., xn) that takes n boolean values as input and returns m boolean values as output, he will use n switches and m LEDs. Mr. Wire Less can quickly assemble the necessary ICs and wires, but the key problem is testing. While testing he has to check with all possible input combination, to make sure whether the output of LED corresponds to the expected output or not. This is taking too long for him, as most of the switches are jammed and difficult to toggle. Mr. Wire Less is asking for help to minimize his time of testing. So, your task is to minimize the total number of switch-toggle throughout the testing. For example, if Mr. Wire Less has to test a function f(x0, x1) of two variables, he may choose this switching-sequence for testing 00, 11, 10, 01. In this case, the total number of switch-toggle will be 2+1+2 = 5. But if he tests in this sequence 00, 10, 11, 01 total number of toggle will be 1+1+1 = 3. Given n, you have to output the minimum number of toggle needed for complete testing. Though it seems impractical, he wants you to solve the problem for a very large value of n. But, then the toggle value can be quite big. So, he is completely okay with the toggle value modulo 8589934592 (233).

Carry All Fruits ,"Chef wants to run a restaurant for N days (numbered 1 through N). First, Chef needs to buy some plates. Each of these plates should have a positive integer capacity.

A plate with capacity c cannot hold more than c fruits and it is called half-full if it holds at least ceil(c/2)ceil(c/2)ceil(c/2) fruits. Initially, all plates are empty and numbered 1 through M. Chef needs to satisfy his guests on each of the N days. For each day i: On the morning of this day, Chef unlocks an infinite supply of fruit of the i-th type. He may use these fruits any number of times during the i-th day and all days that follow. In the afternoon, he may choose up to 4 fruits and add them to some of the plates. The fruits may be of any types (possibly the same type) and they may be added to any plates independently from each other (possibly all to the same plate). For example, if this is the 5-th day and Chef has 3 plates, he may choose fruits of types {1,1,3,4}{1,1,3,4}{1, 1, 3, 4}, add fruits of types 1 and 4 to the second plate and fruits of types 1 and 3 to the third plate. By the evening of this day, he must present a single plate containing at least one of each type of fruit between 1 and i inclusive. Additionally, the plate must be at least half-full, otherwise it would look empty and his guests would not be satisfied. Note that the same plate may be presented multiple times. When a plate is presented, the fruits on it remain (do not get eaten). Help Chef decide the number of plates, the capacity of each plate, as well as the types of fruits to pick each day and the plates to add them to. Chef does not need to minimise the number of plates or their capacities, but the number of plates must not exceed 1,01,01,0 and their capacities must not exceed N. You may find any valid solution.

Now since chef is not that great in deciphering binary strings, he has decided the following criteria to classify the feedback as Good or Bad : If the string contains the substring ""010"" or ""101"", then the feedback is Good, else it is Bad. Note that, to be Good it is not necessary to have both of them as substring. So given some binary strings, you need to output whether according to the chef, the strings are Good or Bad.

Walk ,"Chef and his girlfriend are going to have a promenade. They are walking along the straight road which consists of segments placed one by one. Before walking Chef and his girlfriend stay at the beginning of the first segment, they want to achieve the end of the last segment. There are few problems: At the beginning Chef should choose constant integer - the velocity of mooving. It can't be changed inside one segment. The velocity should be decreased by at least 1 after achieving the end of some segment. There is exactly one shop on each segment. Each shop has an attractiveness. If it's attractiveness is W and Chef and his girlfriend move with velocity V then if V < W girlfriend will run away into the shop and the promenade will become ruined. Chef doesn't want to lose her girl in such a way, but he is an old one, so you should find the minimal possible velocity at the first segment to satisfy all conditions.

Please like me ,"In a far away dystopian world, the measure of the quality of a person’s life is the numbers of likes he gets for an article about their life. For a person to stay alive, he has to acquire at least L number of likes before D days pass. People in this world employ various techniques to increase the number of likes. One of the famous ones is to dis-like and re-like their own article once per day. On doing so you can assume that the number of likes for the post increase by a constant factor C. So if one starts with S likes on Day-1, he would have D2 = S + C * S likes on Day-2, D3 = D2 + D2 * C on Day-3 etc. You are to answer if the person would survive at the end of Day-D or not.

When Chef has reached the bus station he realized that he forgot a gift for his better half in his home. Chef knows that someone can reach his home in dist minutes (his girlfriend also needs dist minutes to get Chef's home after she arrived at the bus station). So, Chef came up with two plans for present the gift: i. The first one is to wait for his girlfriend at the bus station. And then go to the home together with her. When Chef and his girlfriend will reach the home he will present his gift. ii. The second one is to call the girlfriend and ask her to go to his home when she will reach the bus station. And after calling he will go to the home, take the gift, and go towards the girlfriend. When they meet each other he will present his gift (they can meet at any position of the road or at the bus station). It's known that girlfriend and Chef uses the same road between bus station and Chef's home. Please, help Chef to estimate the time in minutes for each of his plans.

Chef and Codes ,"Once upon a time chef decided to learn encodings. And, obviously, he started with the easiest one (well, actually the easiest after Caesar cypher) – substitution cypher. But very soon Chef got bored with encoding/decoding, so he started thinking how to hack this cypher. He already knows some algorithm, which is not always correct, but it’s sufficient for now. Here is its description. Imagine we know frequency sequence of English letters (this means, that letters are sorted by their frequency of appearing in English texts, in ascending order). And let’s find frequency sequence of cyphered letters (if some of them appear equal number of times, then first in frequency sequence will be lower letter between them). Now, using this two frequency sequences we can recover plain text. Just substitute cyphered letter with origin one, if they are at same positions in sequences. Now, Chef has frequency sequence of English letters and cypher text. And he asks you to recover plain text. Please, help him.

They would like to go to the world finals to represent their country and bring back a medal. However, first they have to clear the prelims contest. For that, they have decided to have a practice round before the prelims. They are going to have the practice round from time S to E. However, the team members are not so sure whether they would be able to participate in the practice contest for the whole duration as they already have some previous reservations. To solve that, they have created a list of all the things everyone is supposed to do or reservations they have to fulfil. The list they prepared has a total of N tasks. They have also noted down the time in which each task needs to be done, i.e. the start time and the end time. During that time, at least one of the team members is busy doing that task and would be unavailable for the ICPC pre-prelims practice contest. You are given the time slot LaZyProblemSetters have decided to practice together and the list of tasks with their start and end time that they prepared. Print whether they all would be able to practice together for the full duration of the contest. For this problem, you can assume that if V, J or S ends a task at time T1, he can give his undivided attention to the contest starting from T1 itself and if the contest ends at time T2, they can get back to their reserved tasks at T2 itself.

Chef has a budget: S dollars. He can buy each ingredient at most once. A non-empty subset of these N ingredients (possibly containing all ingredients) is called affordable if the sum of costs of all the ingredients in the subset does not exceed Chef's budget. The tastiness of a dish prepared using a set of ingredients is equal to vKvKv^K, where v is the sum of values of all the ingredients in the set and K is a fixed integer. To make a dish, Chef should use an affordable subset of ingredients. He wants to try out all the dishes he can make. Find the total (summed up) tastiness of all these dishes.

The characters in the strings are indexed from 1. Chef was wondering if he could find the M patterns in the string S in the given order. That is, he wanted to know whether it is possible to choose M ranges, denoted by [li,ri][li,ri][l_i, r_i] for each i (1≤i≤M1≤i≤M1 le i le M), such that 1≤l1≤r1<l2≤r2<…<lM≤rM≤N1≤l1≤r1<l2≤r2<…<lM≤rM≤N1 le l_1 le r_1 lt l_2 le r_2 lt ldots lt l_M le r_M le N and for each valid i, the substring Sli,Sli+1,…,SriSli,Sli+1,…,SriS_{l_i}, S_{l_i + 1}, ldots, S_{r_i} equals PiPiP_i.

Gii and His Club ,"In some faraway land, there is a man named Gii, who is often considered the coolest person that has ever lived. One Saturday evening, he decided to go to a club on the other side of his town. The town is shaped like a grid with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and N columns (numbered 1 through N), where each cell represents a neighbourhood in the city. Let's denote the cell in row r and column c by (r,c)(r,c)(r, c). Gii lives in the cell (1,1)(1,1)(1, 1) and the club is in the cell (N,N)(N,N)(N, N). Gii also has some friends that live in the city; let's denote the number of Gii's friends in cell (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) by Ai,jAi,jA_{i, j}. Of course, if Gii is in some cell, he can move directly to another cell only if it shares a side with his current cell. Also, he is in quite a rush, so he will never increase his distance from the club. More formally, from a cell (i,j)(i,j)(i, j), he may only move to the cell (i+1,j)(i+1,j)(i+1, j) or (i,j+1)(i,j+1)(i, j+1); moving outside the grid is not allowed. Whenever Gii passes through some neighbourhood (including the one where he lives and the one with the club), all his friends from that neighbourhood decide to go to the club with him, since he is so cool. However, there is a problem: the maximum capacity of the club is X+1X+1X+1 people, so Gii may only bring along at most X of his friends. Chef, the club's bouncer, is very strict in imposing this rule (for safety reasons), and Gii does not want to leave any friends outside, so he wants to choose his route to the club in such a way that the number of his friends that arrive at the club with him does not exceed X. Now, Gii is wondering: what is the number of different routes he can take to the club such that he does not bring more than X people with him? Of course, he could immediately calculate this number, but he has better things to do, so he asked you to do it instead.

Prefix as a Substring 2 ,"Given 3 strings S1S1S_1, S2S2S_2 and X, find the number of distinct ordered pairs of strings (P,Q)(P,Q)(P,Q) such that : String P+QP+QP + Q is a substring of X. String P is some prefix of S1S1S_1 (possibly empty). String Q is some prefix of S2S2S_2 (possibly empty). A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. For example, ""chef"" is a substring of ""codechef"", but ""def"" is not. Also, an empty string is a substring of any string. A prefix of a string S is a substring of S that occurs at the beginning of S. For example, ""code"" is a prefix of ""codechef"", but ""chef"" is not. Also, an empty string is a prefix of any string.

Rich Rhyme ,"In the land of Rhyme, the King and his people always speak in rhymes. They are so accustomed in conversing using rhymes that at one point it became monotonous. So what was once a source of happiness and amusement is now creating a strange emotion within the heart of the people. The productivity of the people has become less and more importantly, the happiness index of the land has plummeted. The experts have investigated the whole matter and reported that speaking in rhyme is not the problem; it is the monotony of the same thing that is affecting the people. In fact they suggested changing the definition of rhyme slightly. One of their recommendations is to introduce a new concept of ""richness"" in a sentence. A sentence would be termed rich if it starts and ends with the same word! The King seems to like this definition. But he is finding it difficult to even say a simple meaningful sentence that is ""rich"". The King became quite anxious. Your boss, King’s ICT adviser, suggested that a competition among the general people should be thrown where the participants would have to submit a piece (story/poem/essay etc.) full of rich sentences. Then the richest pieces would be judged and be awarded. The King made a decree accordingly. Your boss was ordered to formulate a judging scheme for the pieces and write a program immediately to do the judgment. And as usual he formulated something and asked you to implement that. What he has asked you to do is as follows. You will take as input a piece as a character array. And output another array where each position will give the richness of the piece up to that position. “What is richness?” You asked. Your boss replied, “The richness is the size of the identical proper substring which is present at the beginning and at the end of the piece. But, the complete string cannot be considered as its substring.” “But you said to calculate the richness at each position”! You inquired. “Yes, of course! When you calculate up to a position, you will have to assume that the piece ends at that position.” Your boss smiled. He seemed to be quite happy in formulating this. You asked again, ""Don't I need to think about the word boundaries?"" “Not now, my son. We will think about it later. Do it without considering word boundaries for now. You will consider the input character by character”. He assured you. He seemed all the more content with his own formulation and probably was not seeing the possible pitfalls. He continued, ""And one other point; richness of the first position would always be 0."" Meaningful, you thought. But you had to ask a final question. “How would you then finally compute the richness of the total piece using all these information? What will be the formula?” Your boss seemed perplexed. He did not think this through, as it seemed. So, he said, “You need not worry about that. Do as I said. Just remember that the input size could be quite large.” You knew that you have to stop asking and start coding now. “Yes, boss!” you said. You also realized the implication of the last direction of your boss. Few years back there was another competition on literary works. And the size of some pieces was 4 million characters!

Aditi and Magic Trick ,"Aditi recently discovered a new magic trick. First, she gives you an integer N and asks you to think an integer between 1 and N. Then she gives you a bundle of cards each having a sorted list (in ascending order) of some distinct integers written on it. The integers in all the lists are between 1 and N. Note that the same integer may appear in more than one card. Now, she shows you these cards one by one and asks whether the number you thought is written on the card or not. After that, she immediately tells you the integer you had thought of. Seeing you thoroughly puzzled, she explains that she can apply the trick so fast because she is just adding the first integer written on the cards that contain the integer you had thought of, and then gives the sum as the answer. She calls a bundle interesting if when the bundle is lexicographically sorted, no two consecutive cards have any number in common. Now she challenges you to find out the minimum number of cards she will need for making an interesting bundle such that the magic trick will work every time.

Abhinav and Electric Circuit ,"Abhinav loves electric circuits. Currently he is working on a new circuit for which he requires some connecting wires. He needs to make a total of N connections and he has mentioned his wire length requirements for each connection in an integer sequence A. There is an electric store near his house, from where he needs to buy wires. It is a very weird store, because you have to decide most of the things yourself, so it takes a lot of thinking. For instance, for buying wires, you need to decide the length of each wire piece, and you'll get as many wire pieces of the chosen length each at unit cost (cost 1 per piece) but you can't get wires of different lengths. Also, you can't cut wire pieces to make new pieces of different (smaller) length(s). Isn't that weird? But you can connect any number of wires together to form a new single wire piece whose length is the sum of lengths of the wires connected. So, Abhinav needs to choose an integer length for buying wires. Abhinav hates to waste anything, and he hates it even more if that thing is money. So help him decide the length of wires so as to minimize the total expenditure. Note: You cannot make a connection which requires a wire piece of length X with a wire piece of length Y if X≠YX≠YX neq Y.

Restaurant Rating ,"Chef has opened up a new restaurant. Like every other restaurant, critics critique this place. The Chef wants to gather as much positive publicity as he can. Also, he is very aware of the fact that people generally do not tend to go through all the reviews. So he picks out the positive reviews and posts it on the website of the restaurant. A review is represented by an integer which is the overall rating of the restaurant as calculated by that particular review. A review is considered to be positive if it is among the top one-third of the total reviews when they are sorted by their rating. For example, suppose the ratings given by 8 different reviews are as follows: 2 8 3 1 6 4 5 7 Then the top one-third reviews will be 8 and 7. Note that we considered one-third to be 8/3=2 top reviews according to integer division. (see Notes) So here is what the Chef wants from you: Given the reviews(ratings) by different critics, the Chef needs you to tell him what is the minimum rating that his website will be displaying. For example in the above case, the minimum rating that will be displayed is 7. Also, different critics keep reviewing the restaurant continuosly. So the new reviews keep coming in. The Chef wants your website ratings to be up-to-date. So you should keep updating the ratings there. At any point of time, the Chef might want to know the minimum rating being displayed. You'll have to answer that query. An interesting thing to note here is that a review might be in the website for some time and get knocked out later because of new better reviews and vice-versa. Notes: To be precise, the number of reviews displayed website will be floor(n / 3), where n denotes the current number of all reviews.

He promised to reveal their secret to Suraj if he gets maximal score in a special ChefLandian game. The game has following rules: In D-dimensional Euclidean space, N lattice points are given. Every pair of points are not connected initially. The points are not guaranteed to be distinct. Let (A1, A2, ., AD) and (B1, B2, ., BD) be the coordinates of the points A and B respectively, then the distance between A and B is defined as ( (A1−B1)2 + (A2−B2)2 + . + (AD−BD)2 )1/2. The initial Suraj's score is 1. Suraj is allowed to take as many turns as he wants. In every turn, Suraj can connect an unconnected pair of two given points, if this new connection does not form a cycle. That is, Suraj cannot connect the pair of points A and B, if there exist points X1, X2, ., Xk such that A connected to X1, X1 connected to X2, X2 connected to X3,., and Xk connected to B. In every time Suraj connects some points, his score is multiplied by the square of the distance between them. Now Suraj wonders what is the maximal score he can get.

Chef and Recipes ,"Chef is making N atomic soups numbered 1 through N. Each soup is either a base atomic soup or a composition of other atomic soups. For each valid i, if soup i is not a base soup, one unit of this soup is made by mixing together one unit of soup ci,1ci,1c_{i, 1}, one unit of soup ci,2ci,2c_{i, 2}, and so on to one unit of soup ci,Pici,Pic_{i, P_i}. Note that these PiPiP_i soup units are not necessarily from distinct soups and that we obtain only 1 unit of soup by mixing PiPiP_i units. Due to their structure, two units of the same base atomic soup always cancel out and vanish when mixed together. Therefore, we define the base decomposition of a soup as the set of all base atomic soups that need to be used an odd number of times when making the resulting soup (i.e. a base soup b belongs to the base decomposition if we need to use an odd number of units of soup b in total). The base decomposition of a sequence of atomic soups is the base decomposition of the soup created by mixing together one unit of each of these soups. You should answer Q queries.

Cucumber Boy and Cucumber Girl ,"As everybody knows, a pizza consists of N ingredients, for instance, crust, sauce, toppings, etc. Long ago in Wolf Town, there were N kinds of pizza shops each selling one ingredient of pizza. Let ingredients and pizza shops be numbered from 1 to N, then pizza shop k selling ingredient k. They had never invaded other shops, namely, they had kept to sell only one ingredient. But the situation changed after some shop violates the unspoken rule. Then all of N pizza shops start to sell all N ingredients and they are competing. As time past, a pizza is now one of the most popular foods, and every pair of pizza shops is collaborated for improving quality. Let pizza shop (j1, j2) denotes the shop collaborated between shops j1 and j2. There are B pizza buildings having every pizza shop, including collaborated shops. The price of a pizza is determined by its quality. Let the quality of ingredient k of pizza shop j in building i be Q[i, j, k]. Then the quality of ingredient k of pizza shop (j1, j2) in building i is Q[i, j1, k] * Q[i, j2, k]. The price of a pizza is the summation of qualities of its ingredients. By the way, live in the Wolf Town. like pizza very much, but now they are bored by the existing pizzas, despite there are many kinds of pizzas. So they want to propose the collaboration between two distinct buildings (say i1 and i2). If their wish is realized, the pizza collaborated between shop j1 in building i1 and j2 in building i2 will be sold. The price of the pizza will be determined by the usual way, that is, the price will bethe summation of Q[i1, j1, k] * Q[i2, j2, k] over 1 ≤ k ≤ N.Note that j1 = j2 is possible here. Now Cucumber Boy chooses two buildings i1 and i2 such that 1 ≤ i1 < i2 ≤ B. In each day want to eat N collaborated pizzas. Here these N pizzas should satisfy the following conditions. Each of N pizzas is a collaborated pizza between one shop in building i1 and one shop in building i2. Every shop in building i1 collaborates for one of N pizzas. Every shop in building i2 collaborates for one of N pizzas. Clearly, there are exactly N! (factorial of N) of such sets of N pizzas. Therefore, will eat all distinct such sets during N! days eating each such set of pizzas exactly once and, of course, eating exactly one such set per day (see the first sample input for clarity). Cucumber Boy is a show-off, so he wants to pay more money than Cucumber Girl. But Cucumber Girl is a steadfast person, so she may disturb it. However if at least one of N pizzas has odd price (that is, the price not divisible by 2), she gives away him to pay more money than her in this day (otherwise, she pays the same amount of money as he pays). But the next time such situation occurs, she will pay more money than Cucumber Boy in this day. Namely, consider all days for which we have at least one pizza with odd price and number them starting from 1. Then in the (2*x−1)-th such day Cucumber Boy pays more money than Cucumber Girl, and in the (2*x)-th such day, Cucumber Girl pays more money than Cucumber Boy. That is, at such days with numbers 1, 3, 5, . Cucumber Boy pays more money than Cucumber Girl, while at such days with numbers 2, 4, 6, . we have the opposite situation. So now Cucumber Boy's objective will be accomplished ifthe number of times that he pays more money than her greater than the number of times that he pays less than her.

For each prefix of length k (from 1 to number of digits in number in the base), the number formed by considering the digits of the prefix in base b is divisible by k. For example, let base Chef is studying be 2. 1 is an easy number as its prefix of length 1 (i.e. 1) is divisible by 1. 2 is also an easy number, as its prefix of length 1 (i.e. 1) is divisible by 1 and the prefix of length 2 (i.e. 2, represented as 10 in base 2) is also divisible by 2. 3 is not an easy number, as its prefix of length 2 (i.e. 3, represented as 11 in base 2) is not divisible by 2.

He asks you to find the number of easy numbers represented in base b and consisting of exactly d digits. As the answer could be quite large, output it modulo 109 + 7.

The Revenge of Jalebi Bai ,"Jalebi Bai recently met her long time friend Barfi Tai. Instead of entertaining her guest, Barfi Tai kept boasting about her K marvelous necklaces made of black and golden beads. Jalebi Bai felt really jealous of it and decided to exact revenge. She has invited Barfi to visit her home next week. Meanwhile, she is planning to buy a truly beautiful necklace to make Barfi jealous. According to her, a truly beautiful necklace should contain each of Barfi’s necklaces as a subsequence of it. Though still trying to show off, Jalebi Bai is smart and does not want to put a lot of money in it. So she wants to buy a truly beautiful necklace containing the minimum number of beads. She goes to Devu Sunar and asks him to provide her such a necklace. Devu Sunar is busy this week and has asked you to help him in building the necklace. Please help him! Note A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements but without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequence [A,B,D] is a subsequence of [A,B,C,D,E,F]. The bead patterns on the necklaces are not considered circular.

I Need Ammo! ,"There are N players in a team playing a famous mobile game Codechef Users' Battlegrounds (CUBG). Each player in the team needs guns to fight the other teams. To use guns the players need ammunition (or ammo). Initially, each player i (1≤i≤N)(1≤i≤N)(1leq ileq N) of the team has AiAiA_i units of ammo. Before they get into any fight, the team leader wanted to make sure that each player has equal amount of ammo (i.e., all AiAiA_i should be the same). There's only two ways he can do so: Exchange 1 unit of ammo between two teammates. Ask a teammate to loot 1 unit of ammo from a nearby building. Each of the above operations can be performed any number of times (including zero). Also, each type of operation takes 1 unit of time to complete. Note that it is not allowed for a player to drop some ammo on the ground (i.e. the total units of ammo cannot decrease).

Digit Multiplication By K ,"There is a strange game played in ChefLand. The game starts with N white balls, the i-th of which has a power of SiSiS_i. It is known that 0≤Si≤90≤Si≤90 leq S_i leq 9. On each level, a black ball with power K hits each of the white balls. After the collision, the power of each white ball is multiplied by K. However, white balls are only allowed to have single-digit power. In order to maintain this, a white ball whose power contains multiple digits splits into several white balls with single-digit power, one per digit. For example, consider a white ball with a power of 4. If K=2K=2K = 2, its resulting power is 8 and it remains a single ball. If K=13K=13K = 13, its resulting power is 525252, so it splits into two white balls with power 5 and 2 respectively. If K=27K=27K = 27, its resulting power is 108108108, so it splits into three white balls with power 1, 0, and 8 respectively. The aim of the game is to determine the number of white balls after M levels. Note that K remains the same for every level. Please help Chef win the game.

Now, zombies are having great difficulties to commute to their offices without cars, so they decided to use the cars available. Every zombie will need only one car. Head zombie called a meeting regarding this, in which he will allow each zombie to select a car for him. Out of all the cars, the head zombie chose one of cars for him. Now, he called his children to choose the cars for them. After that they called their children and so on till each of the zombie had a car. Head zombie knew that it won't be a good idea to allow children to have cars of same color as that of parent, as they might mistakenly use that. So, he enforced this rule during the selection of cars. Professor James Moriarty is a criminal mastermind and has trapped Watson again in the zombie world.

Fly height mode ,"You like tracking airplane flights a lot. Specifically, you maintain history of an airplane’s flight at several instants and record them in your notebook. Today, you have recorded N such records h1, h2, ., hN, denoting the heights of some airplane at several instants. These records mean that airplane was first flying on height h1, then started changing its height to h2, then from h2 to h3 and so on. The airplanes are usually on cruise control while descending or ascending, so you can assume that plane will smoothly increase/decrease its height from hi to hi + 1 with a constant speed. You can see that during this period, the airplane will cover all possible heights in the range [min(hi, hi+1), max(hi, hi+1)] (both inclusive). It is easy to see that the plane will be at all possible heights in the range exactly a single instant of time during this ascend/descend. You are interested in finding the maximum integer K such that the plane was at some height exactly K times during the flight.

B2 - Mayor Ram & Portals (Slightly Hard Version ) ,"Problem statements for this and the Easy version are not same. Read the constraint mentioned in the problem statement. Mayor Ram is back! This time on his vacation he invented a new Portal Chain Machine. This machine has N portals numbered from 1 to N from left to right. Each of these portals also has a value associated with itself. These values are all distinct and lie between 1 to N inclusive. The portals have a special property. A portal with value x is linked to portal with value x+1x+1x+1 and to portal with value x−1x−1x-1. Of course, portal with value 1 and portal with value N are linked to only one other portal. The rest of the portals are linked to two different portals. Now, Mayor Ram controls all the portals and can make any portal send an object from this portal to any other portal linked with the current portal. Hard Version Constraint : Transferring object from one portal to another takes time equal to the absolute difference between the numbers of the two portals. Ex - Transferring from portal with number A to portal with number B takes |A−B||A−B||A-B| units of time. Now , Mayor Ram is wondering what is the minimum amount of time required to transfer objects from one portal to another. Mayor Ram expects you to help him. You will be receiving queries which will have two integers SrcSrcSrc & DestDestDest. And for each query you have to tell the minimum amount of time required to transfer an object from portal with number SrcSrcSrc to portal with number DestDestDest.

The rules of the last battle were simple: Ram's party cannot be defeated because they have the Inochi-crystals. Final Boss' party won't waste time attacking because they saw the Inochi-crystals. During each turn, any member with the highest attacking value in Ram's party will attack any member with the highest health value in Final Boss' party. If the attack value of the attacker is more than the health value of the defender then the attack value of the attacker gets subtracted by health value of the defender and the defender dies. If the health value of the defender is more than the attack value of the attacker,the health value of the defender gets subtracted by the attack value of the attacker and the attacker's attack value becomes 0 (i.e the attacker can't attack in upcoming turns anymore). If the attack value of the attacker is equal to the health value of the defender then the defender dies and the attacker's attack value becomes 0 (i.e the attacker can't attack in upcoming turns anymore).

Many Left ,"The classical game of OneLeft is played as follows. Some pegs are placed on an NxN grid. Initially, at least one cell is empty and at least one contains a peg (each cell contains at most one peg). A move consists of jumping one peg over an adjacent peg to an empty cell, and removing the peg that was jumped over. Formally, if there is a peg in cell (x1, y1), and cell (x2, y2) is empty, and (x1-x2, y1-y2) is one of (0, 2), (0, -2), (2, 0), or (-2, 0), and there is a peg in cell ((x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2), then the peg in cell (x1, y1) may be moved to cell (x2, y2) and the peg in cell ((x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2) removed. The coordinate (0, 0) indicates the top-left corner, (N-1, 0) indicates the top-right corner, (0, N-1) indicates the bottom-left corner, and (N-1, N-1) indicates the bottom-right corner. The game continues until no more moves are possible. Normally the goal of OneLeft is to leave a single peg on the grid. However, in this problem the goal is to leave as many pegs as possible.

The battle will last D days, so each day, daddy buys a contiguous subset of the ingredients defined by index L and R(1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N). Daddy buys all ingredients, one each, from index L to R(inclusive).Now the problem is the calculation of the total cost of the ingredients. The shopkeeper's formula for deciding the total cost of the ingredients is as follows:Let there be K different ingredients with cost C, so the cost with the normal calculation for all these ingredients should be K*C, but according to the shopkeeper, the cost of these ingredients is K*K*C.You need to find out the total cost for each day.

Bob vs ATM ,"Due to shortage of ATMs, a bank decided to convert some arcade gaming machines into ATMs. Unfortunately, due to a bug, the converted machine will only dispense cash if the withdrawer can win the game. The game is played over a valid bracket sequence. Formally a valid bracket sequence is defined as: An empty string is valid If A is a valid bracket sequence, then (A) is also valid If A and B are valid, AB is also valid In each move a player can erase such a non-empty valid sub-string of the remaining brackets such that they cannot be formed by concatenating 2 valid sequences. E.g. a player can erase (()) or (()()) but not ()() or (())(). The ATM always plays first. The player that is not able to make a move will lose the game. Assume that both the players play optimally. Bob is trying to withdraw money and is frustrated as he keeps losing against the machine. He suspects the machine is rigged and always wins the game. So, he has asked you to help him out.

Sweet Shops of Kolkata ,"Park Street in Kolkata is famous for its mouth watering sweets. There are a total of N shops in the market, which are extended over a single street with shops following one another. The shops are enumerated from 1 to N, from left to right. The market is unique in the sense that each shop sells only a single type of sweet. Additionally, no two shops sell the same type of sweet. For convenience, the different types of sweets are numbered from 1 to N. Though the famous market has been running smoothly for many years, the city Mayor decided to have it completely overhauled and aims to make this famous market great again. So he has issued a tender for the shops, which you happened to grab by using your good offices with the Mayor. The tender specifies that you should decide which type of sweet each shop should sell. You would like to do so, while keeping in mind that buyers like purchasing sweets if adjacent shops sell sweets of similar types, because then they can purchase similar type sweets without wandering around many shops. Formally, you would like to minimize the maximum absolute value of difference between the types of sweets in adjacent shops. Two shops which are numbered i and i + 1 (i < N) are said to be adjacent to each other. The city Mayor himself is very fond of sweets and has decided to have his own shop in the market too. He has chosen shop numbered S in which he will sell sweets of type Q. For the remaining N - 1 shops, you have to assign which sweets should be sold so as to minimize the maximum absolute difference in the type of sweets in adjacent shops.

Video Game ,"Zonal Computing Olympiad 2014, 30 Nov 2013 You are playing a video game in which several stacks of boxes are lined up on the floor, with a crane on top to rearrange the boxes, as shown in the picture below. The crane supports the following commands: • Move one position left (does nothing if already at the leftmost position) • Move one position right (does nothing if already at the rightmost position) • Pick up a box from the current stack (does nothing if the crane already has a box) • Drop a box on the current stack (does nothing if the crane doesn't already have a box) Further, there is a limit H on the number of boxes on each stack. If a 'drop' command would result in a stack having more than H boxes, the crane ignores this drop command. If the current stack has no boxes, a 'pick up' command is ignored. You are given the initial number of boxes in each stack and the sequence of operations performed by the crane. You have to compute the final number of boxes in each stack. For example, suppose the initial configuration of the game is as shown in the figure above, with 7 stacks and H=4. Then, after the following sequence of instructions, 1. Pick up box 2. Move right 3. Move right 4. Move right 5. Move right 6. Drop box 7. Move left 8. Pick up box 9. Move left 10. Drop box the number of boxes in each stack from left to right would be 2,1,3,1,4,0,1.

Type 2 barrier - This barrier starts from the ground and extends up to height X above the ground. The height of Edward is H units and he has an alchemic life force of L units. Moreover, he can duck by Y1Y1Y_{1} units and jump by height Y2Y2Y_{2} units (as explained in the figures). He starts crossing barriers in sequence, starting from barrier 1 till the barrier N. Whenever he can't pass a barrier by ducking or jumping (considered passed even when the barrier just touches him), he uses Alchemy to break the barrier.

Every day, an infected person in this binary string can infect an adjacent (the immediate left and right) uninfected person. Therefore, if before Day 1, the population is 00100100100, then at the end of Day 1, it becomes 010010010 and at the end of Day 2, it becomes 111. But people of Karunanagar are smart and they know that if they 'socially isolate' themselves as early as possible, they reduce the chances of the virus spreading.

Therefore, many people are trying to help Pied Piper gain some users. Pied Piper has N supporters with contribution values C1,C2,…,CNC1,C2,…,CNC_1, C_2, ldots, C_N. For each valid i, when the i-th supporter contributes, Pied Piper gains CiCiC_i users instantly. After contributing, the contribution value of the supporter is halved, i.e. CiCiC_i changes to ⌊Ci/2⌋⌊Ci/2⌋leftlfloor C_i / 2 rightrfloor. Each supporter may contribute any number of times, including zero. Supporters may contribute at any time until one of the companies takes over Pipernet, even during the current day. Find the minimum number of times supporters must contribute (the minimum total number of contributions) so that Pied Piper gains control of Pipernet.

Chef and An Ideal Problem ,"""An ideal problem has no test data."" - aryanc403 This is an interactive problem. Chef likes probability puzzles a lot, almost as much as interactive problems. Today, he learned about the Monty Hall Paradox. Suppose that Chef is participating in a game show, where he has to choose between three doors numbered 1 through 3. There is a car behind one of the doors and goats behind the other two. Chef does not know what is behind which door, but there is a game host who knows where the car is. First, you need to help Chef pick a door (let's denote it by X). Then, the host opens a different door (let's denote it by Y) such that there is a goat behind this door, and asks Chef to pick an arbitrary door again (let's denote it by Z). You need to help Chef pick door Z too. You should do it in such a way that the probability of a car being behind door Z is maximised. If there are multiple optimal possible ways to pick doors for Chef, you may choose any one. Interaction First, you should print a line containing a single integer X (1≤X≤31≤X≤31 le X le 3).

Strike or Spare ,"Chef's company wants to make ATM PINs for its users, so that they could use the PINs for withdrawing their hard-earned money. One of these users is Reziba, who lives in an area where a lot of robberies take place when people try to withdraw their money. Chef plans to include a safety feature in the PINs: if someone inputs the reverse of their own PIN in an ATM machine, the Crime Investigation Department (CID) are immediately informed and stop the robbery. However, even though this was implemented by Chef, some people could still continue to get robbed. The reason is that CID is only informed if the reverse of a PIN is different from that PIN (so that there wouldn't be false reports of robberies). You know that a PIN consists of N decimal digits. Find the probability that Reziba could get robbed. Specifically, it can be proven that this probability can be written as a fraction P/QP/QP/Q, where P≥0P≥0P ge 0 and Q>0Q>0Q gt 0 are coprime integers; you should compute P and Q.

Xenny and Coin Rankings ,"Xenny reverse-engineered all the binaries released by the International Security Agency (ISA) during summer vacation just to pass time. As a reward, the ISA gave him infinite ByteCoins. Out of sheer boredom and a sense of purposelessness in life, Xenny decided to arrange the Coins on a 2-Dimensional Euclidean Plane. The boredom was so strong that he arranged these coins in a specific pattern, as opposed to the usual, monotonous way of storing coins in a Piggy Bank. On each integer co-ordinate (x, y) where x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0, a single coin was placed. And each coin was assigned a rank. The following pattern was followed in the arrangement: Let's denote the co-ordinates of the kth coin by (xk, yk) and its rank by Rk. For any 2 coins i, j: if (xi + yi) < (xj + yj) or ( (xi + yi) == (xj + yj) and xi < xj) then Ri < Rj. We sort all the coins by this comparison. The index of the coin (C) in this sorted list of coins (1-indexed) is its rank. Each query is as follows: Given (U, V). Among the coins that are lying on or inside the rectangle with its diagonal end-points being (0, 0) and (U, V), which is the coin that has the maximum rank?

You must help Max determine x. You may perform operations of two types: Connect the panel to voltage y, where y is an arbitrary integer between 1 and N inclusive. This operation costs 1 coin, and you may only perform it if the panel is not broken. After this operation, you find out whether the panel is broken. Fix the broken panel.

Then, Chef must choose a direction for each force vector in such a way that the net force (vector sum of all forces) is equal to zero.

Social Cluster ,"This problem deals with the effective formation of a cluster among K individuals living in a society. A society can be represented as a N × N grid. Individuals are located at certain points on the grid. Each individual's social interaction is measured by a positive integer, called interaction power denoted by Ii. The dissimilarity between two individuals is defined as the absolute difference between their interaction powers. Less the absolute difference between interaction powers of two individuals, more the probability that they will interact with each other. Now your task is to form a single cluster of individuals by displacing some individuals from their original positions. Formally, a cluster means a connected component. An individual at point (xi, yi) is said to be adjacent to another individual at point (xj, yj) if and only if |xi − xj| ≤ 1 and |yi − yj| ≤ 1. What needs to be optimized ? The cost of clustering is defined as Score = 10×A + 10×B , where A and B are two variables. The task is to minimize this cost. We define A first. Suppose P be the set of individuals on the grid and |P| = K. In order to create the cluster, we may need to displace some individuals from their original positions on the grid. Let the individual pi be displaced by a Manhattan distance di in order to become a part of the cluster.Now di = |xi(final) − xi(initial)| + |yi(final) − yi(initial)|.Here (xi(initial), yi(initial)) is the initial position of individual pi and (xi(final), yi(final)) is the position of the same individual after becoming a part of the cluster.Now A = Σ (di / Ii) where i = 1 to K.Here Ii = Interaction power of individual pi.The variable B is defined after the cluster is formed.B = Σ ( si / ni ) , where i = 1 to K.si = Σ (|Ij − Ii| ), where { pj ∈ P | pj is adjacent to pi }.ni = Number of individuals adjacent to pi.

Brackets ,"A valid parentheses sequence is a non-empty string where each character is either '(' or ')', which satisfies the following constraint: You can find a way to repeat erasing adjacent pairs of parentheses '()' until it becomes empty. For example, '(())' and '()()()' are valid parentheses sequences, but ')()(' and '(()' are not. Mike has a valid parentheses sequence. He really likes everything about his sequence, except the fact that it is quite long. So Mike has recently decided that he will replace his parentheses sequence with a new one in the near future. But not every valid parentheses sequence will satisfy him. To help you understand his requirements we'll introduce the pseudocode of function F(S): FUNCTION F( S - a valid parentheses sequence ) BEGIN balance = 0 max_balance = 0 FOR index FROM 1 TO LENGTH(S) BEGIN if S[index] == '(' then balance = balance + 1 if S[index] == ')' then balance = balance - 1 max_balance = max( max_balance, balance ) END RETURN max_balance END In other words, F(S) is equal to the maximal balance over all prefixes of S.

(Challenge) SnackDown 99 ,"This is an interactive problem. SnackDown 2099 will take part in the ChefLand International Office (CIO). Ada is in charge of preparation of the coding environment. Ada prepared N computer terminals (numbered 1 through N) interconnected by M bidirectional networking cables (numbered 1 through M). Each of the cables connects two different terminals and no two different cables connect the same pair of terminals. Let's denote a cable between terminals u and v by (u,v)(u,v)(u, v). At the contest site, there should be some guards that make sure everything runs smoothly. During the competition, each terminal is assigned either to a contestant or to a guard; note that the number of contestants is not fixed yet. Ada assigns a stability to each terminal. Let's denote the stability of terminal i by SiSiS_i. Also, let's denote the cost of removing cable i by WiWiW_i. Since there are many cables, the room is messy, so Ada decided to remove some of the cables (possibly none or all of them) one by one. However, after removing any cable, the stability of some terminal or the cost of removing some cable might change. Ada thinks that it is dangerous to have cables directly connect terminals assigned to contestants (they could try to team up and share solutions!). To measure the danger of such a situation, she defined DCDCD_C as the sum of Su⋅SvSu⋅SvS_u cdot S_v over all remaining cables (u,v)(u,v)(u, v) such that the terminals u and v are both assigned to contestants. Similarly, Ada thinks that it is dangerous to have cables directly connect terminals assigned to guards (they could start chatting and get distracted!). To measure the danger of this situation, she defined DGDGD_G similarly to DCDCD_C, as the sum of Su⋅SvSu⋅SvS_u cdot S_v over all remaining cables (u,v)(u,v)(u, v) such that the terminals u and v are both assigned to guards. Let's denote the total cost of removing cables (sum of costs for all removed cables when they were removed) by X. Ada wants to minimise X+DC+DGX+DC+DGX+D_C+D_G. Help her prepare the coding environment! Specifically, choose some cables to remove and then assign the terminals to contestants or guards in such a way that X+DC+DGX+DC+DGX+D_C+D_G is as small as possible. Interaction First, you should read 3+M3+M3+M lines describing the original network configuration. The first of these lines contains two space-separated integers N and M. The second line contains N space-separated integers S1,S2,…,SNS1,S2,…,SNS_1, S_2, ldots, S_N denoting the initial stabilities of the terminals. The third line contains M space-separated integers W1,W2,…,WMW1,W2,…,WMW_1, W_2, ldots, W_M denoting the initial costs of removing cables. Each of the next M lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that terminals u and v are connected by a networking cable. Then, you should remove cables. To remove a cable, you should print a line containing a single integer w (1≤w≤M1≤w≤M1 le w le M) denoting the number of the cable you want to remove. You must not attempt to remove the same cable twice. Then, you should read a line describing any changes in the stabilities or costs after this cable is removed, in one of the following formats: 0 i x (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N1 le i le N) denoting that the new value of SiSiS_i is x 1 i y (1≤i≤M1≤i≤M1 le i le M) denoting that the new value of WiWiW_i is y 2 denoting that the stabilities and costs did not change When you do not want to remove any more cables, you must print a line containing the integer −1−1-1. Finally, you must print a line containing a single string with length N. For each valid i, the i-th character of this string should be 'C' if the i-th terminal is assigned to a contestant or 'G' if it is assigned to a guard. If your output is invalid or you attempt to remove a cable multiple times, you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

The score of a submission is the sum of scores of all test files. Your goal is to minimise the score of your submission. There are twenty test files. During the contest, the displayed score will account for exactly four test files, i.e. your score reflects your submission's performance on 20% (4/20) of the test files. However, if your program gets a non-AC verdict on any test file, your submission's verdict will be non-AC. In other words, an AC verdict denotes that your program runs successfully on all the test files. After the end of the contest, your score will be changed to include the sum of your program's scores over the other sixteen test files. Test generation The grader is given probabilities pvpvp_v, pwpwp_w, and three numbers MXSMXSMX_S, MNWMNWMN_W and MXWMXWMX_W. For all test cases, N=512N=512N = 512 and MXS=1024MXS=1024MX_S = 1024. There are three types of networks: Complete: There is a cable between each pair of terminals. Hamiltonian: There is a sequence of terminals a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aNa_1, a_2, ldots, a_N such that there is a cable between terminals aiaia_i and ai+1ai+1a_{i+1} for each valid i and a cable between terminals aNaNa_N and a1a1a_1. The number of cables in this network is approximately N(N−1)/5N(N−1)/5N (N-1) / 5. Special networks. The stabilities are generated uniformly randomly between 1 and MXSMXSMX_S inclusive and the removal costs are generated uniformly randomly between MNWMNWMN_W and MXWMXWMX_W inclusive. Whenever you remove a cable, the grader decides to modify the stability of some terminal with probability pvpvp_v, the cost of removing some cable with probability pwpwp_w, or to do nothing (with probability 1−pv−pw1−pv−pw1-p_v-p_w). The stabilities and removal costs are changed using one of the following strategies: Pure Random: Stabilities: Choose a terminal uniformly randomly and change its stability to a random integer between 1 and MXSMXSMX_S. Removal costs: Uniformly randomly choose a cable that has not been removed yet and change its removal cost to a random integer between 1 and MXWMXWMX_W. Shrink: Stabilities: Choose a terminal uniformly randomly and change its stability to a random number between 1 and MXSMXSMX_S. Removal costs: Let c0,c1,…,cm−1c0,c1,…,cm−1c_0, c_1, ldots, c_{m-1} be the cables that are still in the network, sorted first by their current removal costs and then by their indices. Generate a uniformly random number d between 0 and 99 inclusive and choose a cable crcrc_r uniformly randomly. Let X be the current cost of removing crcrc_r. If 2⋅r≤m2⋅r≤m2 cdot r le m, then the new cost of removing cable crcrc_r will be min(X+d,MXW)min(X+d,MXW)mathrm{min},(X+d, MX_W). Otherwise, the new cost of removing this cable will be max(X−d,1)max(X−d,1)mathrm{max}(X-d, 1). Adaptative: Let r be the index of the cable you just decided to remove. Stabilities: Choose one of the terminals connected by r uniformly randomly. Let X denote the current stability of that terminal. Generate a uniformly random number d between 0 and 191919. With probability 0.30.30.3, the new stability of this terminal will be min(X+d,MXS)min(X+d,MXS)mathrm{min},(X+d, MX_S). With probability 0.70.70.7, the new stability of this terminal will be max(X−d,1)max(X−d,1)mathrm{max},(X-d, 1). Removal costs: Let c be the smallest index of a cable such that it has not been removed yet and its removal cost is greater or equal to the cost of removing cable r. If no such cable exists, then c is the largest index of a cable with maximum removal cost (that has not been removed yet). Change the removal cost of cable c to a uniformly random integer between 1 and MXWMXWMX_W.

(Challenge) Coloring Triangulations ,"After solving the 64×64×6464×64×6464 times 64 times 64 Rubik's cube, Chef Ada moved to arts. For her next masterpiece, Ada drew an abstract painting as follows: N points (numbered 1 through N) are painted on a 2D canvas. Some of these points are red ('R'), some are blue ('B') and the rest are green ('G'). No three points are collinear. A triangulation, i.e. a maximum set of non-intersecting triangles such that the vertices of each triangle are three of the points painted in the previous step, is drawn on the canvas. The edges of the triangles are black and the colours of the points are unaffected by this. Triangles may share edges or vertices, only intersections with positive area are not allowed. Ada is not satisfied with her painting, so she wants to modify it a bit using the following operations: Change the colour of a point. The cost of this operation is X. Flip one edge: if there is a convex quadrilateral which contains this edge as a diagonal, erase this edge and draw a new edge corresponding to the other diagonal of this quadrilateral. (Note that some edges cannot be flipped. It can be proved that if such a quadrilateral exists, it is unique and the resulting drawing also corresponds to a triangulation.) The cost of this operation is Y. The operations may be performed multiple times in any order. Let's denote the number of operations of the first type by C and the number of operations of the second type by F. Performing many operations could ruin the painting, though, so Ada wants to perform at most P operations of the first type (C≤PC≤PC le P) and at most Q operations of the second type (F≤QF≤QF le Q). Ada thinks that a triangle is ugly if at least two of its vertices have the the same colour. Let U be the number of ugly triangles after performing the operations. Help Ada choose the operations to perform in a way that minimises G=X⋅C+Y⋅F+U2G=X⋅C+Y⋅F+U2G = X cdot C + Y cdot F + U^2, where X and Y are given coefficients.

(Challenge) Codechef War II ,"Chefland is a country with N cities (numbered 1 through N) and M bidirectional roads (numbered from 1 through M). Each road connects two different cities and no two different roads connect the same pair of cities. Bitland declared war on Chefland and after multiple battles, all roads of Chefland have ended up in a very bad state. Moreover, the war is causing psychological damage to the citizens of Chefland — for each valid u, the non-eagerness of the inhabitants of city u on day d is Eu(d)=Pu+Qu⋅dEu(d)=Pu+Qu⋅dE_u(d) = P_u + Q_u cdot d. In Chefland, there are K special cities that are very important strategically. Ada, the queen of Chefland, decided to repair some roads and construct new roads in such a way that if any one of these roads is destroyed, it is still possible to reach each special city from any other special city using only the roads that were repaired or constructed. It is allowed to work on repairing and constructing different roads simultaneously, but to keep Chefland stable, Ada ordered that on each day, the number of roads that are being repaired and/or constructed must be at most S. Also, whenever we start repairing or constructing a road, the work on that road cannot be paused until the road is finished. The earliest day on which we can start repairing or constructing a road is day 1; let's denote the last day on which we finish repairing or constructing a road by T. The queen does not want to wait too much, so for each day between 1 and T inclusive, there must be at least one road which is currently being constructed or repaired. Note that this means T cannot exceed the time it would take to repair and construct all roads. For each valid i, the i-th of the original roads connected cities UiUiU_i and ViViV_i, its length was LiLiL_i kilometres and the cost of repairing it is described by two parameters AiAiA_i and BiBiB_i. The workers of Chefland can only repair one kilometer of road per day and it is not allowed to work on different parts of a road at the same time, so it takes exactly LiLiL_i days to repair this road. If we start repairing this road on day d, it costs Ai+Bi⋅dAi+Bi⋅dA_i + B_i cdot d. For each pair of different cities u and v, let's denote the length of the shortest path between these cities before the original roads were damaged (before Chefland's invasion) by Du,vDu,vD_{u, v}. Then, it takes Du,vDu,vD_{u, v} days to construct a brand new road between the cities u and v. This road does not pass through any cities other than u and v. If we start constructing this road on day d, it costs (Eu(d)+Ev(d))⋅Du,v(Eu(d)+Ev(d))⋅Du,v(E_u(d)+E_v(d)) cdot D_{u, v}. It is not allowed to construct a road between two cities if they are already directly connected by a road or if they were originally directly connected by a road. Help Ada design a plan that minimises the total cost. Formally, determine which roads should be repaired, which ones should be constructed and for each of these roads, determine the day on which the work on this road should start. The total cost of this plan should be as small as possible, while all other constraints must be satisfied perfectly. Tags: alei ",https://www.codechef.com/problems/CHFWAR2,CC
Cut the Cake (Challenge) ,"There are N points in a plane (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the coordinates of the i-th point are (Xi,Yi)(Xi,Yi)(X_i, Y_i). No three of these points are collinear. Let's denote a line segment between points u and v by (u,v)(u,v)(u,v). You are given a Delaunay triangulation of those points, which consists of M triangles (numbered 1 through M). For each valid i, the vertices of the i-th triangle are the points Pi,1,Pi,2,Pi,3Pi,1,Pi,2,Pi,3P_{i,1}, P_{i,2}, P_{i,3}. You may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Flip diagonal segment (u,v)(u,v)(u,v): If there is a convex quadrilateral that contains this segment as a diagonal and does not contain any points other than its vertices, erase this segment and draw a new segment corresponding to the other diagonal of this quadrilateral. (Note that some segments cannot be flipped. It can be proved that if such a quadrilateral exists, it is unique and the result is also a triangulation.) Then, you should perform the following operation some number of times: Remove a segment (u,v)(u,v)(u,v) that is shared by two regions with finite areas. When it is removed, the number of regions decreases by one. A region is defined as a maximal set in the plane such that it does not contain any of the given points or currently existing segments and it is possible to move from each point in this set to any other point in this set without crossing any edge. Note that a region is not necessarily convex. Two regions share a line segment if it is possible to move from one of these regions to the other one by crossing only this segment. After performing all operations, there must be exactly R regions with finite areas. Let A1,A2,…,ARA1,A2,…,ARA_1, A_2, ldots, A_R be these areas sorted in non-decreasing order. You are given the desired areas B1,B2,…,BRB1,B2,…,BRB_1, B_2, ldots, B_R of the regions, also sorted in non-decreasing order. Your goal is to make ∑Ri=1|Bi−2⋅Ai|∑i=1R|Bi−2⋅Ai|sum_{i=1}^R |B_i - 2cdot A_i| as small as possible by performing operations. However, you may only perform up to 1,0241,0241,024 operations of the first type; note that the number of operations of the second type must always be M−RM−RM-R.

Ants (Challenge) ,"You are given a directed weighted graph with N vertices (numbered 1 through N) and M edges (numbered 1 through M). For each valid i, the i-th edge is initially directed from a vertex uiuiu_i to a vertex viviv_i and it has a flipping cost WiWiW_i. There is one ant living in each vertex of the graph. Let's denote a directed edge from a vertex u to a vertex v by (u,v)(u,v)(u, v). The outdegree of a vertex u is the number of vertices v such that there is an edge (u,v)(u,v)(u, v) in the graph. A vertex u is adjacent to a vertex v if there is an edge (u,v)(u,v)(u, v) in the graph. The queen of ants wants to gather all ants in at most K distinct vertices. In order to do that, she may perform the following instructions in any order, any number of times: 1 i: Flip the i-th edge ― if the edge was (u,v)(u,v)(u, v) before this instruction, it becomes (v,u)(v,u)(v, u). The cost of performing such an instruction is WiWiW_i antcoins and it can be used at most 5⋅1055⋅1055 cdot 10^5 times. 2: The queen orders that each ant which is currently in a vertex with outdegree 1 must move to the only vertex adjacent to it. All ants move at once and when there are multiple ants that have to move from some vertex, they move together. The cost of performing such an instruction is S antcoins and it can be used at most 700700700 times. After all instructions are performed, the number of distinct vertices which still contain ants must be at most K. Find a way to achieve this with as little cost as possible.
